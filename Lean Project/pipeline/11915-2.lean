# Multivariate quotients of polynomial functors.

Basic definition of multivariate QPF. QPFs form a compositional framework
for defining inductive and coinductive types, their quotients and nesting.

The idea is based on building ever larger functors. For instance, we can define
a list using a shape functor:

```lean
inductive ListShape (a b : Type)
  | nil : ListShape
  | cons : a -> b -> ListShape
```

This shape can itself be decomposed as a sum of product which are themselves
QPFs. It follows that the shape is a QPF and we can take its fixed point
and create the list itself:

```lean
def List (a : Type) := fix ListShape a -- not the actual notation
```

We can continue and define the quotient on permutation of lists and create
the multiset type:

```lean
def Multiset (a : Type) := QPF.quot List.perm List a -- not the actual notion
```

And `Multiset` is also a QPF. We can then create a novel data type (for Lean):

```lean
inductive Tree (a : Type)
  | node : a -> Multiset Tree -> Tree
```

An unordered tree. This is currently not supported by Lean because it nests
an inductive type inside of a quotient. We can go further and define
unordered, possibly infinite trees:

```lean
coinductive Tree' (a : Type)
| node : a -> Multiset Tree' -> Tree'
```

by using the `cofix` construct. Those options can all be mixed and
matched because they preserve the properties of QPF. The latter example,
`Tree'`, combines fixed point, co-fixed point and quotients.
