This means that for every \(\epsilon > 0\), there exists a \(\delta > 0\) such that for all complex numbers \(z_1, z_2 \in \mathbb{C}\), if \(|z_1 - z_2| < \delta\), then \(|\text{Im}(z_1) - \text{Im}(z_2)| < \epsilon\).

Given that the sequence of functions \(f_n\) converges uniformly to \(g\) on the set \(K\) with respect to the filter \(p\), we can use the property of uniform continuity of \(\text{Im}\).

To prove \( n \leq m + \text{dist}(m, n) \), we consider the definition of the distance function on natural numbers. The distance function \(\text{dist}(m, n)\) is defined as the absolute value of the difference between \( m \) and \( n \), i.e., \(\text{dist}(m, n) = |m - n|\).

Since the commutativity of addition in the natural numbers states that \( a + b = b + a \), we can rewrite the goal \( m \leq n + \text{dist}(n, m) \) as \( m \leq \text{dist}(n, m) + n \).

2. **Step 2:**
The distance function \(\text{dist}(n, m)\) is defined as the absolute difference between \( n \) and \( m \), which is \( |n - m| \). In the natural numbers, this is equivalent to the maximum of \( n - m \) and \( m - n \), but since \( n - m \) and \( m - n \) are non-negative, we have:

- If \( n \geq m \), then \(\text{dist}(n, m) = n - m\). Thus, the inequality becomes:

Adding \( m \) to both sides, we get:

1. **Symmetry of Distance Function:**
Since the distance function is symmetric, we have:
\[
\text{dist}(n, m) = \text{dist}(m, n)
\]
Therefore, the goal \( n \leq \text{dist}(n, m) + m \) can be rewritten as:
\[
n \leq \text{dist}(m, n) + m
\]

2. **Definition of Distance Function:**
The distance function \(\text{dist}(m, n)\) is defined as the truncated subtraction \(|m - n|\), which is the non-negative difference between \(m\) and \(n\). This means:
\[
\text{dist}(m, n) = |m - n|

3. **Case Analysis:**
We consider two cases based on the values of \(m\) and \(n\):

In this case, \(\text{dist}(m, n) = m - n\). Substituting this into the goal, we get:
\[

\]
Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[
n \leq m - n + m = 2m - n
\]
Since \(m \geq n\), we have \(2m - n \geq n\). Therefore, the inequality \(n \leq 2m - n\) holds.

\[

Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[
n \leq n - m + m = n

- We use the commutativity of multiplication to rewrite \( k \cdot n \) as \( n \cdot k \) and \( k \cdot m \) as \( m \cdot k \). This gives us:
\[
\text{dist}(k \cdot n, k \cdot m) = \text{dist}(n \cdot k, m \cdot k)

2. **Step 2: Right Multiplication Preserves Distance**
- We apply the theorem that right multiplication preserves distance, which states that for any \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{N} \), \(\text{dist}(a \cdot c, b \cdot c) = \text{dist}(a, b)\). This gives us:
\[

3. **Step 3: Commutativity of Multiplication Again**
- We use the commutativity of multiplication again to rewrite \( k \cdot \text{dist}(n, m) \) as \(\text{dist}(n, m) \cdot k\). This gives us:
\[
\text{dist}(n, m) \cdot k = k \cdot \text{dist}(n, m)

- The final goal is now:
\[
k \cdot \text{dist}(n, m) = k \cdot \text{dist}(n, m)

\[
\text{dist}(n, m) = n - m + (m - n)

Applying this definition to both \(\text{dist}(n \cdot k, m \cdot k)\) and \(\text{dist}(n, m)\), we have:
\[
\text{dist}(n \cdot k, m \cdot k) = (n \cdot k - m \cdot k) + (m \cdot k - n \cdot k)

Applying this property, we get:

(n - m + (m - n)) \cdot k = (n - m) \cdot k + (m - n) \cdot k

(a - b) \cdot c = a \cdot c - b \cdot c

Applying this property to both terms, we get:

\[

\[

\]

Next, we consider the right-hand side of the equation:
\[
(x_1 y_1 - x_2 y_2)^2 + (x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_1)^2
\]
We expand each square term:
\[
(x_1 y_1 - x_2 y_2)^2 = x_1^2 y_1^2 - 2 x_1 y_1 x_2 y_2 + x_2^2 y_2^2
\]
\[
(x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_1)^2 = x_1^2 y_2^2 + 2 x_1 y_2 x_2 y_1 + x_2^2 y_1^2
\]

Adding these two expanded forms together:
\[
(x_1 y_1 - x_2 y_2)^2 + (x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_1)^2 = (x_1^2 y_1^2 - 2 x_1 y_1 x_2 y_2 + x_2^2 y_2^2) + (x_1^2 y_2^2 + 2 x_1 y_2 x_2 y_1 + x_2^2 y_1^2)
\]
\[

We see that both the left-hand side and the right-hand side simplify to the same expression:
\[
x_1^2 y_1^2 + x_1^2 y_2^2 + x_2^2 y_1^2 + x_2^2 y_2^2
\]

Thus, we have shown that:
\[

We use the following definitions and properties:
1. The Legendre symbol \(\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)\) is defined as the quadratic character of \(a\) modulo \(p\). Specifically:
- \(\left(\frac{a}{p}\right) = 0\) if \(a \equiv 0 \pmod{p}\),
- \(\left(\frac{a}{p}\right) = 1\) if \(a\) is a nonzero square modulo \(p\),
- \(\left(\frac{a}{p}\right) = -1\) otherwise.
2. The canonical homomorphism from the integers to the field \(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}\) preserves multiplication, i.e., for any integers \(m\) and \(n\),
\[
\text{Int.cast}(m \cdot n) = (\text{Int.cast}(m)) \cdot (\text{Int.cast}(n)).
\]
3. The quadratic character function \(\chi\) in a finite field \(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}\) is multiplicative, i.e., for any elements \(a, b \in \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}\),
\[
\chi(a \cdot b) = \chi(a) \cdot \chi(b).
\]

Using these properties, we can simplify the goal:
\[
\left(\frac{a \cdot b}{p}\right) = \chi(a \cdot b) = \chi(a) \cdot \chi(b) = \left(\frac{a}{p}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{b}{p}\right).

1. **Case 1: \( n = 0 \)**
- If \( n = 0 \), the goal \( \frac{m \mod (0 \cdot k)}{0} = \left( \frac{m}{0} \right) \mod k \) is trivially true because both sides are undefined.

2. **Case 2: \( n > 0 \)**
- We now consider two cases for \( k \):
1. **Case 2.1: \( k = 0 \)**
- If \( k = 0 \), the goal \( \frac{m \mod (n \cdot 0)}{n} = \left( \frac{m}{n} \right) \mod 0 \) is trivially true because both sides are undefined.
2. **Case 2.2: \( k > 0 \)**
- We focus on the right-hand side of the equation \( \left( \frac{m}{n} \right) \mod k \). Using the identity \( m \% (n \cdot k) + (n \cdot k) \cdot (m / (n \cdot k)) = m \), we rewrite the right-hand side as:
\[
\left( \frac{m \% (n \cdot k) + (n \cdot k) \cdot (m / (n \cdot k))}{n} \right) \% k.
\]
- Using the associativity of multiplication, we rewrite \( (n \cdot k) \cdot (m / (n \cdot k)) \) as \( n \cdot (k \cdot (m / (n \cdot k))) \). Thus, the right-hand side becomes:
\[
\left( \frac{m \% (n \cdot k) + n \cdot (k \cdot (m / (n \cdot k)))}{n} \right) \% k.
\]
- Using the identity \( (x + y \cdot z) / y = x / y + z \) for \( y > 0 \), we rewrite the expression inside the modulo as:
\[
\left( \frac{m \% (n \cdot k)}{n} + k \cdot (m / (n \cdot k)) \right) \% k.
\]
- Using the identity \( (x + y \cdot z) \% y = x \% y \), we simplify the expression to:
\[
\left( \frac{m \% (n \cdot k)}{n} \right) \% k.
\]
- Finally, we use the fact that \( m \% (n \cdot k) < n \cdot k \) and \( n > 0 \) and \( k > 0 \) to show that \( \frac{m \% (n \cdot k)}{n} < k \). This implies:
\[
\left( \frac{m \% (n \cdot k)}{n} \right) \% k = \frac{m \% (n \cdot k)}{n}.

- Therefore, the original goal \( \frac{m \mod (n \cdot k)}{n} = \left( \frac{m}{n} \right) \mod k \) holds.

**Base Case:**
For \( k = 0 \), we need to show that \(\text{hyperoperation}(2, m, 0) = m \cdot 0\). By the definition of the hyperoperation function, \(\text{hyperoperation}(2, m, 0) = 0\). Since \( m \cdot 0 = 0 \) for any natural number \( m \), the base case holds.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume that \(\text{hyperoperation}(2, m, bn) = m \cdot bn\) for some natural number \( bn \). We need to show that \(\text{hyperoperation}(2, m, bn + 1) = m \cdot (bn + 1)\).

Using the recursive definition of the hyperoperation function, we have:

**Base Case:**
For \( n = 0 \), we need to show that for all \( k \), \(\text{hyperoperation}(0 + 3, 1, k) = 1\).

Let \( k \) be an arbitrary natural number. By the definition of the hyperoperation, \(\text{hyperoperation}(3, 1, k) = 1^k\). Since \(1^k = 1\) for any natural number \( k \), we have \(\text{hyperoperation}(0 + 3, 1, k) = 1\).

**Base Case:**
For \( k = 0 \), we use the identity that for any natural numbers \( n \) and \( m \), \(\text{hyperoperation}(n + 3, m, 0) = 1\). Therefore, \(\text{hyperoperation}(3, m, 0) = 1\). This simplifies our goal to \( 1 = m^0 \). By the property of exponents in monoids, \( m^0 = 1 \). By symmetry, \( 1 = m^0 \) holds.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume the statement holds for \( k = bn \), i.e., \(\text{hyperoperation}(3, m, bn) = m^bn\). We need to show that \(\text{hyperoperation}(3, m, bn + 1) = m^{bn + 1}\).

Using the recursion property of the hyperoperation function, we have:
\[
\text{hyperoperation}(3, m, bn + 1) = \text{hyperoperation}(2, m, \text{hyperoperation}(3, m, bn))
\]
By the inductive hypothesis, \(\text{hyperoperation}(3, m, bn) = m^bn\). Therefore:
\[
\text{hyperoperation}(3, m, bn + 1) = \text{hyperoperation}(2, m, m^bn)
\]
Using the identity \(\text{hyperoperation}(2, m, k) = m \cdot k\), we get:
\[
\text{hyperoperation}(3, m, bn + 1) = m \cdot m^bn
\]
By the property of exponents in monoids, \( m \cdot m^bn = m^{bn + 1} \). By symmetry, \( m \cdot m^bn = m^{bn + 1} \) holds.

Thus, by induction, \(\text{hyperoperation}(3, m, k) = m^k\) for all natural numbers \( k \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)","theorem hyperoperation_three : hyperoperation 3 = (· ^ ·) := by

Specifically, we simplify the proposition using the definitions of `range`, `List.mem_map`, `List.mem_range`, `lt_toNat`, `lt_sub_iff_add_lt`, and the commutativity of addition. This simplification gives us:
\[
r \in m.range n \leftrightarrow \exists a, m + a < n \land m + a = r

To prove the equivalence, we need to show both directions:

1. **If \( r \in m.range n \), then \( m \leq r \) and \( r < n \):**
- Assume \( r \in m.range n \). This means there exists an integer \( a \) such that \( m + a < n \) and \( m + a = r \).
- From \( m + a = r \), we have \( r = m + a \).
- Since \( a \) is a non-negative integer (as \( m + a < n \)), we have \( 0 \leq a \).
- By the property of non-negative right addends, \( m \leq m + a \), which simplifies to \( m \leq r \).
- Also, \( m + a < n \) directly gives \( r < n \).
- Therefore, \( m \leq r \) and \( r < n \).

2. **If \( m \leq r \) and \( r < n \), then \( r \in m.range n \):**
- Assume \( m \leq r \) and \( r < n \).
- Consider \( a = r - m \).
- Since \( m \leq r \), we have \( 0 \leq r - m \).
- By the property of the canonical map from non-negative integers to natural numbers, \( \text{Int.toNat}(r - m) = r - m \).
- Therefore, \( m + \text{Int.toNat}(r - m) = m + (r - m) = r \).
- Also, \( m + (r - m) < n \) simplifies to \( r < n \).

\]
The sine of \( z \) is given by:
\[
\sin z = \frac{\exp(-z \cdot i) - \exp(z \cdot i)}{2i}
\]
and the cosine of \( z \) is given by:
\[
\cos z = \frac{\exp(z \cdot i) + \exp(-z \cdot i)}{2}

Thus, the goal is to show:

We now construct a lemma \( h1 \) that states:
\[
\exp(z \cdot i) + \exp(-z \cdot i) = \exp(-z \cdot i) \cdot (\exp(2i z) + 1)

Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition and the property of the exponential function, we rewrite the goal as:

Simplifying the expression using the properties of multiplication by one and the cancellation property of addition, we get:
\[
\exp(z \cdot i) = \exp(-z \cdot i + 2i z)
\]
By applying ring normalization, we conclude that the equation holds.

Using the associative property of multiplication and the property of the exponential function, we rewrite the goal as:
\[

We use the property that the sum of two summable functions is also summable. Specifically, if \( f \) and \( g \) are summable, then the function \( h \) defined by \( h(n) = f(n) + g(n) \) is also summable. In our case, the function \( h \) is the pointwise sum \( f + g \).

  simp","To prove the theorem, we need to show that the composition \( g \circ f \) has a Fréchet derivative \( g' \circ f' \) at \( x \) along the filter \( L \). This means we need to show that the difference \( (g \circ f)(x') - (g \circ f)(x) - (g' \circ f')(x' - x) \) is little-o of \( x' - x \) along the filter \( L \).

1. **Step 1:**
Let \( \text{eq}_1 \) denote the result of the transitivity of the big-O and little-o asymptotic notations. Specifically, since \( g' \) is a continuous linear map, the composition \( g' \circ (f(x') - f(x) - f'(x' - x)) \) is big-O of \( f(x') - f(x) - f'(x' - x) \) along the filter \( L \). By the Fréchet derivative little-o property of \( f \), \( f(x') - f(x) - f'(x' - x) \) is little-o of \( x' - x \) along the filter \( L \). Therefore, \( g' \circ (f(x') - f(x) - f'(x' - x)) \) is little-o of \( x' - x \) along the filter \( L \).

2. **Step 2:**
Let \( \text{eq}_2 \) denote the result of the transitivity of the little-o and big-O asymptotic notations. Specifically, since \( g \) has a Fréchet derivative \( g' \) at \( f(x) \) along the filter \( L' \), the difference \( g(x') - g(f(x)) - g'(x' - f(x)) \) is little-o of \( x' - f(x) \) along the filter \( L' \). By the composition of little-o functions and the fact that \( f \) maps \( L \) to \( L' \), the composition \( (g(x') - g(f(x)) - g'(x' - f(x))) \circ f \) is little-o of \( x' - x \) along the filter \( L \). Additionally, by the Fréchet differentiability of \( f \), \( f(x') - f(x) \) is big-O of \( x' - x \) along the filter \( L \). Therefore, \( (g(x') - g(f(x)) - g'(x' - f(x))) \circ f \) is little-o of \( x' - x \) along the filter \( L \).

3. **Step 3:**
To show that \( g \circ f \) has a Fréchet derivative \( g' \circ f' \) at \( x \) along the filter \( L \), it suffices to show that the difference \( (g \circ f)(x') - (g \circ f)(x) - (g' \circ f')(x' - x) \) is little-o of \( x' - x \) along the filter \( L \). We use the triangle inequality for little-o functions and the congruence property of little-o functions. Specifically, we have:
\[
(g \circ f)(x') - (g \circ f)(x) - (g' \circ f')(x' - x) = (g \circ f)(x') - (g \circ f)(x) - g'(f(x') - f(x)) + g'(f(x') - f(x)) - (g' \circ f')(x' - x).
\]
By \( \text{eq}_2 \), \( (g \circ f)(x') - (g \circ f)(x) - g'(f(x') - f(x)) \) is little-o of \( x' - x \) along the filter \( L \).
By \( \text{eq}_1 \), \( g'(f(x') - f(x)) - (g' \circ f')(x' - x) \) is little-o of \( x' - x \) along the filter \( L \).
Therefore, by the triangle inequality, \( (g \circ f)(x') - (g \circ f)(x) - (g' \circ f')(x' - x) \) is little-o of \( x' - x \) along the filter \( L \).

4. **Step 4:**
Simplify the expression \( g'(f(x') - f(x) - f'(x' - x)) = g'(f(x') - f(x)) - (g' \circ f')(x' - x) \). This simplification is straightforward and follows from the linearity of \( g' \).

Thus, we have shown that \( g \circ f \) has a Fréchet derivative \( g' \circ f' \) at \( x \) along the filter \( L \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)","theorem HasFDerivAtFilter.comp {g : F → G} {g' : F →L[𝕜] G} {L' : Filter F}

1. **Base Case:**
- If \( xs \) is the empty list, then \( x \in [] \) is false, and the goal is trivially satisfied.

2. **Inductive Step:**
- Assume the statement holds for a list \( ys \). We need to show it holds for the list \( y :: ys \).

- **Case 1: \( ys \) is the empty list:**
- If \( ys \) is the empty list, then \( xs = [y] \).
- We need to show that \( [y].\text{nextOr}(x, d) = [y].\text{nextOr}(x, d') \).
- Since \( x \in [y] \) simplifies to \( x = y \) and \( x \neq [y].\text{getLast} \) simplifies to \( x \neq y \), we get a contradiction. Therefore, the goal is satisfied.

- We need to show that \( (y :: z :: zs).\text{nextOr}(x, d) = (y :: z :: zs).\text{nextOr}(x, d') \).

- **Subcase 1: \( x = y \):**
- Using the fact that \( (y :: z :: zs).\text{nextOr}(x, d) = z \) and \( (y :: z :: zs).\text{nextOr}(x, d') = z \), both sides are equal to \( z \), and the goal is satisfied.

- **Subcase 2: \( x \neq y \):**
- Using the definition of \( \text{nextOr} \), the goal simplifies to showing that \( x \in z :: zs \) and \( x \neq (z :: zs).\text{getLast} \).
