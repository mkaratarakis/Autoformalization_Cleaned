1. **Informal Theorem**  
Logarithmic Derivative of Constant Function is Zero : For any nontrivially normed fields \(\mathbb{𝕜}\) and \(\mathbb{𝕜}'\) and any constant \( a \in \mathbb{𝕜}' \), the logarithmic derivative of the constant function \( f(x) = a \) is zero, i.e., \(\logDeriv(f(x)) = 0\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by introducing a new variable \( x \) to reason about the logarithmic derivative of the constant function \( f(x) = a \). The logarithmic derivative of a function \( f \) at a point \( x \) is defined as \(\logDeriv(f, x) = \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}\).

Since \( f(x) = a \) is a constant function, its derivative \( f'(x) = 0 \). Therefore, the logarithmic derivative of \( f \) at \( x \) is:
\[
\logDeriv(f, x) = \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} = \frac{0}{a} = 0
\]
This holds for any \( x \in \mathbb{K} \). Hence, the logarithmic derivative of the constant function \( f(x) = a \) is zero. This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
