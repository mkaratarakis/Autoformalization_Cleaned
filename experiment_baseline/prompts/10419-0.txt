1. **Informal Theorem**  
Logarithmic Derivative of Identity Function: \(\frac{d}{dx} \log(x) = \frac{1}{x}\) : For any nontrivially normed field \(\mathbb{K}\) and any element \( x \in \mathbb{K} \), the logarithmic derivative of the identity function at \( x \) is equal to \(\frac{1}{x}\), i.e., \(\frac{d}{dx} \log(\text{id}(x)) = \frac{1}{x}\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the theorem, we start by using the definition of the logarithmic derivative. The logarithmic derivative of a function \( f \) at a point \( x \) is given by \(\logDeriv(f, x) = \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}\).

For the identity function \(\text{id}(x) = x\), we have:
- The derivative of the identity function is \(\text{id}'(x) = 1\).
- The value of the identity function at \( x \) is \(\text{id}(x) = x\).

Using these, the logarithmic derivative of the identity function at \( x \) is:
\[
\logDeriv(\text{id}, x) = \frac{\text{id}'(x)}{\text{id}(x)} = \frac{1}{x}
\]

Thus, we have shown that \(\logDeriv(\text{id}, x) = \frac{1}{x}\). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
