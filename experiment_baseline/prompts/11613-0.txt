1. **Informal Theorem**  
Intrinsic Closure of a Closed Set in Affine Span Equals the Set Itself : For any set \( s \subseteq P \) in a normed additive torsor, if the preimage of \( s \) under the canonical map from the affine span of \( s \) to \( P \) is closed, then the intrinsic closure of \( s \) is equal to \( s \) itself, i.e., \(\text{intrinsicClosure}(\mathbb{K}, s) = s\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by using the definition of the intrinsic closure. The intrinsic closure of a set \( s \) is the image of the closure of \( s \) in its affine span under the canonical map. Given that the preimage of \( s \) under the canonical map is closed, the closure of this preimage is equal to the preimage itself. Therefore, the intrinsic closure of \( s \) is the image of the preimage of \( s \) under the canonical map.

Next, we use the property of the image of the preimage. If \( s \) is a subset of the range of the canonical map, then the image of the preimage of \( s \) is equal to \( s \). To show that \( s \) is a subset of the range of the canonical map, we note that \( s \) is contained in its affine span. The range of the canonical map from the subtype to the set \( s \) is exactly \( s \). By transitivity of the subset relation, if \( s \) is a subset of its affine span and the range of the canonical map is \( s \), then \( s \) is a subset of the range of the canonical map.

Thus, the intrinsic closure of \( s \) is equal to \( s \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
