1. **Informal Theorem**  
Identity Map on Multivariate Polynomial Functor Elements : For any natural number \( n \) and any multivariate polynomial functor \( F \) of \( n \) variables that is an instance of `MvQPF`, and for any type vector \( \alpha \) of length \( n \), the identity function applied to an element \( x \) of the type \( F \alpha \) results in the same element \( x \). In other words, for any \( x \in F \alpha \), it holds that \( \text{id}_\alpha \cdot x = x \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that \( \text{id}_\alpha \cdot x = x \) for any \( x \in F \alpha \), we start by using the properties of the multivariate polynomial functor \( F \). Specifically, we use the fact that the absolute value and representation of a multivariate polynomial functor are inverses, and the property that the absolute value of a multivariate polynomial functor preserves mapping. This allows us to rewrite the goal as follows:

\[
\text{id}_\alpha \cdot x = x \quad \text{is equivalent to} \quad \text{abs}(\text{id}_\alpha \cdot \text{repr}(x)) = \text{abs}(\text{repr}(x))
\]

Since the identity function \( \text{id}_\alpha \) applied to \( \text{repr}(x) \) is just \( \text{repr}(x) \), the left-hand side simplifies to \( \text{abs}(\text{repr}(x)) \). Therefore, the goal becomes:

\[
\text{abs}(\text{repr}(x)) = \text{abs}(\text{repr}(x))
\]

This equality is trivially true due to the reflexive property of equality, since both sides are the same. Hence, we have shown that \( \text{id}_\alpha \cdot x = x \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
