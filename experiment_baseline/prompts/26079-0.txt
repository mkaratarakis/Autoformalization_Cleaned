1. **Informal Theorem**  
Sum Equals Zero in Natural Numbers with Bottom Element: \( n + m = 0 \leftrightarrow n = 0 \land m = 0 \) : For any elements \( n \) and \( m \) in the type \( \mathbb{N} \cup \{\bot\} \) (natural numbers with a bottom element adjoined), the sum \( n + m \) is equal to 0 if and only if both \( n \) and \( m \) are equal to 0.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We need to show that \( n + m = 0 \) if and only if \( n = 0 \) and \( m = 0 \) for any \( n, m \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\bot\} \).

1. **Case 1: \( n = \bot \)**
- We need to show that \( \bot + m = 0 \) if and only if \( \bot = 0 \) and \( m = 0 \).
- Using the property that adding the bottom element to any element results in the bottom element, we have \( \bot + m = \bot \).
- Since \( \bot \neq 0 \), the only way \( \bot + m = 0 \) is if \( m = 0 \). However, \( \bot \neq 0 \), so this case is vacuously true.

2. **Case 2: \( n = a \) for some \( a \in \mathbb{N} \)**
- We need to consider the cases for \( m \).

- **Subcase 2.1: \( m = \bot \)**
- We need to show that \( a + \bot = 0 \) if and only if \( a = 0 \) and \( \bot = 0 \).
- Using the property that adding the bottom element to any element results in the bottom element, we have \( a + \bot = \bot \).
- Since \( \bot \neq 0 \), the only way \( a + \bot = 0 \) is if \( a = 0 \). However, \( \bot \neq 0 \), so this subcase is vacuously true.

- **Subcase 2.2: \( m = b \) for some \( b \in \mathbb{N} \)**
- We need to show that \( a + b = 0 \) if and only if \( a = 0 \) and \( b = 0 \).
- Using the property that the sum of two nonnegative elements is zero if and only if both elements are zero, we have \( a + b = 0 \) if and only if \( a = 0 \) and \( b = 0 \).

Since all cases have been considered and the conditions are satisfied, we conclude that \( n + m = 0 \) if and only if \( n = 0 \) and \( m = 0 \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
