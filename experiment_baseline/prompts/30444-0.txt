1. **Informal Theorem**  
ω-limit Subset under Tending Function in Filters : For any types \( \tau \), \( \alpha \), and \( \beta \) where \( \beta \) is a topological space, and for any function \( \phi : \tau \to \alpha \to \beta \) and set \( s \subseteq \alpha \), if \( m : \tau \to \tau \) is a function such that \( m \) tends to \( f_2 \) along the filter \( f_1 \) (denoted as \( m \to f_2 \) as \( t \to f_1 \)), then the ω-limit of \( s \) under the function \( \phi \circ m \) with respect to the filter \( f_1 \) is a subset of the ω-limit of \( s \) under \( \phi \) with respect to the filter \( f_2 \). Formally, this is expressed as:
\[
\text{If } m \to f_2 \text{ as } t \to f_1, \text{ then } \omega\text{-limit}(f_1, \phi \circ m, s) \subseteq \omega\text{-limit}(f_2, \phi, s).
\]

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the theorem, we need to show that the ω-limit of \( s \) under \( \phi \circ m \) with respect to the filter \( f_1 \) is a subset of the ω-limit of \( s \) under \( \phi \) with respect to the filter \( f_2 \).

1. **Monotonicity of Double Indexed Intersection:**
We use the monotonicity of the double indexed intersection of sets. For any set \( u \in f_2 \), we need to show that the closure of the image of \( s \) under \( \phi \circ m \) in \( m^{-1}(u) \) is a subset of the closure of the image of \( s \) under \( \phi \) in \( u \). This reduces to showing that \( m^{-1}(u) \in f_1 \) and that the closure of the image of \( s \) under \( \phi \circ m \) in \( m^{-1}(u) \) is a subset of the closure of the image of \( s \) under \( \phi \) in \( u \).

2. **Rewriting the Goal:**
We use the property of the binary image of sets under function composition to rewrite the goal. Specifically, the binary image of \( s \) and \( m^{-1}(u) \) under \( \phi \circ m \) is equal to the binary image of \( s \) and \( m^{-1}(u) \) under the function \( (t, x) \mapsto \phi(m(t), x) \). This simplifies our goal to showing that the closure of the image of \( s \) under \( \phi \) in \( m(m^{-1}(u)) \) is a subset of the closure of the image of \( s \) under \( \phi \) in \( u \).

3. **Monotonicity of Closure and Subset Relation:**
We use the monotonicity of the closure and the subset relation to complete the proof. Specifically, since \( m(m^{-1}(u)) \subseteq u \) (by the property of the image of the preimage), the image of \( s \) under \( \phi \) in \( m(m^{-1}(u)) \) is a subset of the image of \( s \) under \( \phi \) in \( u \). Therefore, the closure of the image of \( s \) under \( \phi \) in \( m(m^{-1}(u)) \) is a subset of the closure of the image of \( s \) under \( \phi \) in \( u \).

Thus, we have shown that the ω-limit of \( s \) under \( \phi \circ m \) with respect to the filter \( f_1 \) is a subset of the ω-limit of \( s \) under \( \phi \) with respect to the filter \( f_2 \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
