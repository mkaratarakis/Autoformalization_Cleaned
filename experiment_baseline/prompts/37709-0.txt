1. **Informal Theorem**  
For any two functions $f$ and $g$ with finite formal power series representations $pf$ and $pg$ at point $x$ up to degrees $n$ and $m$ respectively, show that the sum function $f + g$ has a finite formal power series representation at $x$ up to degree $\max(n, m)$.

2. **Informal Proof**  
Given that $f$ has a finite formal power series representation $pf$ at $x$ up to degree $n$ and $g$ has a finite formal power series representation $pg$ at $x$ up to degree $m$, we need to show that the sum function $f + g$ has a finite formal power series representation at $x$ up to degree $\max(n, m)$.

1. **Existence of a Common Radius:**
Since $f$ has a finite formal power series representation $pf$ at $x$ up to degree $n$, there exists a positive radius $r$ such that $f$ has a finite formal power series representation on the ball of radius $r$ around $x$. Similarly, since $g$ has a finite formal power series representation $pg$ at $x$ up to degree $m$, there exists a positive radius $r$ such that $g$ has a finite formal power series representation on the ball of radius $r$ around $x$. We denote this common radius by $r$ and the corresponding properties by $hr.1$ and $hr.2$.

2. **Sum of Finite Formal Power Series:**
On the ball of radius $r$ around $x$, the sum function $f + g$ has a finite formal power series representation. This is because the sum of the formal power series representations $pf$ and $pg$ is also a finite formal power series representation. Specifically, the formal power series representation of $f + g$ is $pf + pg$ and the degree is $\max(n, m)$.

Therefore, the sum function $f + g$ has a finite formal power series representation at $x$ up to degree $\max(n, m)$. This completes the proof. $\blacksquare$
