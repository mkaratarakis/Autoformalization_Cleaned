1. **Informal Theorem**  
Path in Set Implies Both Endpoints are in the Set : For any topological space \( X \) and any subset \( F \subseteq X \), if there is a path \( \gamma \) joining points \( x \) and \( y \) such that the image of \( \gamma \) is contained in \( F \), then both \( x \) and \( y \) are elements of \( F \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
Given a topological space \( X \) and a subset \( F \subseteq X \), suppose there is a path \( \gamma \) joining points \( x \) and \( y \) such that the image of \( \gamma \) is contained in \( F \). This means there exists a continuous function \( \gamma : [0, 1] \to X \) such that \( \gamma(0) = x \), \( \gamma(1) = y \), and \( \gamma(t) \in F \) for all \( t \in [0, 1] \).

To prove that \( x \in F \) and \( y \in F \), we note that since \( \gamma(t) \in F \) for all \( t \in [0, 1] \), it follows that \( \gamma(0) \in F \) and \( \gamma(1) \in F \). By the definition of the path \( \gamma \), we have \( \gamma(0) = x \) and \( \gamma(1) = y \). Therefore, \( x \in F \) and \( y \in F \).

This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
