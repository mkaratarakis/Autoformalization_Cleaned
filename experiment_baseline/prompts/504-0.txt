1. **Informal Theorem**  
Bornology Extensionality: \( \text{cobounded}_t = \text{cobounded}_{t'} \to t = t' \) : For any type \( \alpha \) and any two bornologies \( t \) and \( t' \) on \( \alpha \), if the cobounded filters of \( t \) and \( t' \) are equal, then the bornologies \( t \) and \( t' \) are equal. In other words, if \( \text{cobounded}_t = \text{cobounded}_{t'} \), then \( t = t' \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by considering the structure of the bornologies \( t \) and \( t' \). Since both \( t \) and \( t' \) are bornologies on \( \alpha \), they each consist of a cobounded filter and a proof that this filter contains the cofinite filter. Specifically, we can write \( t \) as \( \{ \text{cobounded}_t, \text{le\_cofinite}_t \} \) and \( t' \) as \( \{ \text{cobounded}_{t'}, \text{le\_cofinite}_{t'} \} \).

Given the assumption that \( \text{cobounded}_t = \text{cobounded}_{t'} \), we need to show that \( t = t' \). To do this, it suffices to show that the cobounded filters \( \text{cobounded}_t \) and \( \text{cobounded}_{t'} \) are equal and that the proofs \( \text{le\_cofinite}_t \) and \( \text{le\_cofinite}_{t'} \) are equal. Since \( \text{cobounded}_t = \text{cobounded}_{t'} \) by assumption, and both \( \text{le\_cofinite}_t \) and \( \text{le\_cofinite}_{t'} \) are proofs that the cobounded filters contain the cofinite filter, they are trivially equal. Therefore, \( t = t' \).

This completes the proof.
