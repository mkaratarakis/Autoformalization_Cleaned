1. **Informal Theorem**  
Logarithmic Derivative of Integer Power: \(\logDeriv (x^n) = \frac{n}{x}\) : For any element \( x \) in a nontrivially normed field \( \mathbb{𝕜} \) and any integer \( n \), the logarithmic derivative of the function \( f(x) = x^n \) at \( x \) is given by \( \frac{n}{x} \). Formally, this can be written as:
\[
\logDeriv (x^n) = \frac{n}{x}.
\]

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the theorem, we start by using the theorem that the logarithmic derivative of \( f(x)^n \) is \( n \cdot \logDeriv f(x) \). Specifically, for the function \( f(x) = x \), we have:
\[
\logDeriv (x^n) = n \cdot \logDeriv (x).
\]
Next, we use the theorem that the logarithmic derivative of the identity function \( f(x) = x \) is \( \frac{1}{x} \), so:
\[
\logDeriv (x) = \frac{1}{x}.
\]
Substituting this into our previous equation, we get:
\[
\logDeriv (x^n) = n \cdot \frac{1}{x} = \frac{n}{x}.
\]
Thus, the logarithmic derivative of \( x^n \) at \( x \) is indeed \( \frac{n}{x} \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
