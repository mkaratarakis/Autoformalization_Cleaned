1. **Informal Theorem**  
Square of Element Greater Than or Equal to One Implies Element Greater Than or Equal to One: \( 1 \leq a^2 \to 1 \leq a \) : For any lattice-ordered group \( \alpha \) and any element \( a \in \alpha \), if \( 1 \leq a^2 \), then \( 1 \leq a \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove \( 1 \leq a \), it suffices to show that \( (a \sqcap 1) \cdot (a \sqcap 1) = a \sqcap 1 \). If this is true, then by the properties of meet and multiplication, we can conclude \( 1 \leq a \).

We simplify the expression \( (a \sqcap 1) \cdot (a \sqcap 1) \) step by step using the following properties:
1. Distributivity of meet over multiplication: \( c \cdot (a \sqcap b) = (c \cdot a) \sqcap (c \cdot b) \),
2. Distributivity of meet over multiplication: \( (a \sqcap b) \cdot c = (a \cdot c) \sqcap (b \cdot c) \),
3. Definition of square in a monoid: \( a^2 = a \cdot a \),
4. Multiplicative identity: \( a \cdot 1 = a \),
5. Multiplicative identity: \( 1 \cdot a = a \),
6. Associativity of meet: \( (a \sqcap b) \sqcap c = a \sqcap (b \sqcap c) \),
7. Left idempotence of meet: \( a \sqcap (a \sqcap b) = a \sqcap b \),
8. Commutativity of meet: \( a \sqcap b = b \sqcap a \),
9. Associativity of meet: \( (a \sqcap b) \sqcap c = a \sqcap (b \sqcap c) \),
10. Meet identity: \( 1 \leq a^2 \) implies \( 1 \sqcap a^2 = 1 \).

Thus, we have:
\[
(a \sqcap 1) \cdot (a \sqcap 1) = (a \cdot a) \sqcap (1 \cdot a) \sqcap (a \sqcap 1) = a^2 \sqcap a \sqcap (a \sqcap 1) = a \sqcap (1 \sqcap a^2) = a \sqcap 1
\]
This completes the proof of the new goal, and hence \( 1 \leq a \). Therefore, the theorem is proved. \(\blacksquare\)
