1. **Informal Theorem**  
Epsilon NFA Evaluation from Empty Set Results in Empty Set : For any epsilon Nondeterministic Finite Automaton \( M \) with alphabet \( \alpha \) and state type \( \sigma \), and for any list of characters \( x \) in \( \alpha \), the set of states that can be reached from the empty set of states by evaluating the string \( x \) is the empty set, i.e., \( M.\text{evalFrom}(\emptyset, x) = \emptyset \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We prove the statement by induction on the list \( x \).

1. **Base Case:**
- We need to show that \( M.\text{evalFrom}(\emptyset, []) = \emptyset \).
- By the property that the evaluation of \( M \) from any set of states \( S \) with an empty input list is the ε-closure of \( S \), we have:
\[
M.\text{evalFrom}(\emptyset, []) = M.\text{εClosure}(\emptyset)
\]
- Since the ε-closure of the empty set of states is the empty set, we get:
\[
M.\text{εClosure}(\emptyset) = \emptyset
\]
- Therefore, \( M.\text{evalFrom}(\emptyset, []) = \emptyset \).

2. **Inductive Step:**
- Assume that \( M.\text{evalFrom}(\emptyset, x) = \emptyset \) for some list \( x \).
- We need to show that \( M.\text{evalFrom}(\emptyset, x ++ [a]) = \emptyset \) for any character \( a \) in the alphabet \( \alpha \).
- By the property that the evaluation of \( M \) from a set of states \( S \) with a list \( x \) followed by a singleton list containing \( a \) is equal to the step set of the evaluation of \( M \) from \( S \) with \( x \) and the input symbol \( a \), we have:
\[
M.\text{evalFrom}(\emptyset, x ++ [a]) = M.\text{stepSet}(M.\text{evalFrom}(\emptyset, x), a)
\]
- Using the inductive hypothesis \( M.\text{evalFrom}(\emptyset, x) = \emptyset \), we get:
\[
M.\text{stepSet}(\emptyset, a) = \emptyset
\]
- Since the step set of the empty set of states is the empty set, we conclude that:
\[
M.\text{evalFrom}(\emptyset, x ++ [a]) = \emptyset
\]

By induction, we have shown that for any list \( x \) of characters in \( \alpha \), \( M.\text{evalFrom}(\emptyset, x) = \emptyset \). This completes the proof.
