1. **Informal Theorem**  
\( p \)-adic Norm of Zero is Zero : For any prime number \( p \), the \( p \)-adic norm of \( 0 \) is \( 0 \), i.e., \( \lvert 0 \rvert_p = 0 \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that the \( p \)-adic norm of \( 0 \) is \( 0 \), we use the definition of the \( p \)-adic norm. The \( p \)-adic norm of a rational number \( q \) is defined as follows:
- If \( q \neq 0 \), the \( p \)-adic norm of \( q \) is \( p^{-\text{padicValRat}(p, q)} \).
- If \( q = 0 \), the \( p \)-adic norm of \( q \) is \( 0 \).

Since \( 0 \) is the rational number in question, we directly apply the second part of the definition. Therefore, the \( p \)-adic norm of \( 0 \) is \( 0 \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
