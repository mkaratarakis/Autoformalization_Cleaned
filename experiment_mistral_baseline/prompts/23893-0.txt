1. **Informal Theorem**  
Almost Everywhere Measurability of Function from Real and Imaginary Parts : For any type \(\alpha\) and a real or complex-like field \(\mathbb{𝕜}\), if a function \( f : \alpha \to \mathbb{𝕜} \) is almost everywhere measurable with respect to a measure \(\mu\) on \(\alpha\) in both its real and imaginary parts, then \( f \) itself is almost everywhere measurable with respect to \(\mu\). Formally, if \( \text{AEMeasurable}(\text{Re}(f), \mu) \) and \( \text{AEMeasurable}(\text{Im}(f), \mu) \), then \( \text{AEMeasurable}(f, \mu) \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that \( f \) is almost everywhere measurable, we start by noting that the real part \( \text{Re}(f) \) and the imaginary part \( \text{Im}(f) \) of \( f \) are both almost everywhere measurable with respect to the measure \(\mu\).

1. **Step 1:**
We use the fact that the sum of two almost everywhere measurable functions is almost everywhere measurable. Specifically, we consider the real part of \( f \) and the imaginary part of \( f \) multiplied by the imaginary unit \( i \). Since the real part \( \text{Re}(f) \) and the imaginary part \( \text{Im}(f) \) are both almost everywhere measurable, and the canonical coercion from real numbers to the real or complex-like field is measurable, the functions \( \text{Re}(f) \) and \( \text{Im}(f) \cdot i \) are almost everywhere measurable. Therefore, their sum \( \text{Re}(f) + \text{Im}(f) \cdot i \) is almost everywhere measurable. We need to show that this sum is equal to \( f \).

2. **Step 2:**
We use the property that for any element \( z \) in a real or complex-like field, the sum of its real part and its imaginary part multiplied by the imaginary unit \( i \) is equal to \( z \). This property is symmetric, so we can write \( f(x) = \text{Re}(f(x)) + \text{Im}(f(x)) \cdot i \). This completes the proof that \( f \) is almost everywhere measurable.

Thus, we have shown that if \( \text{AEMeasurable}(\text{Re}(f), \mu) \) and \( \text{AEMeasurable}(\text{Im}(f), \mu) \), then \( \text{AEMeasurable}(f, \mu) \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
