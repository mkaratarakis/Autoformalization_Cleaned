1. **Informal Theorem**  
Sum Equals Three in `WithBot ℕ` if and only if Specific Pairs of Elements : For any elements \( n \) and \( m \) in the type `WithBot ℕ`, the sum \( n + m \) is equal to 3 if and only if one of the following conditions holds:
- \( n = 0 \) and \( m = 3 \)
- \( n = 1 \) and \( m = 2 \)
- \( n = 2 \) and \( m = 1 \)
- \( n = 3 \) and \( m = 0 \)

2. **Informal Proof**  
We need to show that for any elements \( n \) and \( m \) in the type `WithBot ℕ`, the sum \( n + m = 3 \) if and only if one of the specified pairs of elements holds. We will consider all possible cases for \( n \) and \( m \).

1. **Case 1: \( n = \bot \)**
- If \( n = \bot \), then \( \bot + m = 3 \). Since \( \bot \) is the bottom element, \( \bot + m = \bot \) for any \( m \). Therefore, \( \bot + m = 3 \) is false. The right-hand side of the equivalence is also false because each disjunct involves \( \bot \) being equal to a natural number, which is impossible. Hence, the equivalence holds trivially.

2. **Case 2: \( n = a \) for some \( a \in \mathbb{N} \)**
- **Subcase 2.1: \( m = \bot \)**
- If \( m = \bot \), then \( a + \bot = 3 \). Since \( \bot \) is the bottom element, \( a + \bot = \bot \) for any \( a \). Therefore, \( a + \bot = 3 \) is false. The right-hand side of the equivalence is also false because each disjunct involves \( \bot \) being equal to a natural number, which is impossible. Hence, the equivalence holds trivially.
- **Subcase 2.2: \( m = b \) for some \( b \in \mathbb{N} \)**
- If both \( n = a \) and \( m = b \) for some \( a, b \in \mathbb{N} \), the goal is to show that \( a + b = 3 \leftrightarrow a = 0 \land b = 3 \lor a = 1 \land b = 2 \lor a = 2 \land b = 1 \lor a = 3 \land b = 0 \). Using the fact that the canonical inclusion of natural numbers into `WithBot ℕ` preserves addition, we can simplify the goal to the known result that the sum of two natural numbers equals 3 if and only if one of the pairs \((0, 3)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 1)\), or \((3, 0)\) holds. This completes the proof.

Thus, we have shown that the sum \( n + m = 3 \) in `WithBot ℕ` if and only if one of the specified pairs of elements holds.
