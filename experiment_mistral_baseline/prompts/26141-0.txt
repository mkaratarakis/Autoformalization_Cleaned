1. **Informal Theorem**  
Left Element is Less Than or Equal to Maximum in Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \( a \) and \( b \), it holds that \( a \leq \max(a, b) \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that \( a \leq \max(a, b) \) for any natural numbers \( a \) and \( b \), we consider two cases based on the relationship between \( a \) and \( b \).

1. **Case 1: \( a \leq b \)**
- By the definition of the maximum function, \(\max(a, b) = b\) if \( a \leq b \).
- Therefore, \( a \leq \max(a, b) \) simplifies to \( a \leq b \), which is true by our assumption.

2. **Case 2: \( a \not\leq b \)**
- By the definition of the maximum function, \(\max(a, b) = a\) if \( a \not\leq b \).
- Therefore, \( a \leq \max(a, b) \) simplifies to \( a \leq a \), which is always true by the reflexive property of the less than or equal to relation.

Since both cases cover all possible relationships between \( a \) and \( b \), we conclude that \( a \leq \max(a, b) \) holds for any natural numbers \( a \) and \( b \). This completes the proof.
