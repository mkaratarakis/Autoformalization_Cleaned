1. **Informal Theorem**  
Invertible Elements are Equal if Their Inverses are Equal: \( a = b \to ⅟a = ⅟b \) : For any type \( \alpha \) that is a monoid, if \( a \) and \( b \) are elements of \( \alpha \) and both are invertible, then \( a = b \) implies \( ⅟a = ⅟b \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
Given that \( a \) and \( b \) are elements of a monoid \( \alpha \) and both are invertible, we need to show that if \( a = b \), then \( ⅟a = ⅟b \).

1. **Substitution:**
Since we have the hypothesis that \( a = b \), we can substitute \( b \) with \( a \) in the goal. This simplifies the goal to \( ⅟a = ⅟a \).

2. **Conclusion:**
The equation \( ⅟a = ⅟a \) is trivially true because any element is equal to itself.

Therefore, we have shown that if \( a = b \), then \( ⅟a = ⅟b \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
