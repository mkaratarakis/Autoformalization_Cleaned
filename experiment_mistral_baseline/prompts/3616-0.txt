1. **Informal Theorem**  
Lift of Continuum Cardinality is Equal to Continuum: \( \mathfrak{c}^{\max(v, u_1)} = \mathfrak{c} \) : The cardinality of the continuum, denoted by \( \mathfrak{c} \), remains unchanged when lifted to a higher universe. Specifically, for any universe \( v \) and \( u_1 \), the lift of \( \mathfrak{c} \) from universe \( v \) to universe \( \max(v, u_1) \) is equal to \( \mathfrak{c} \) itself, i.e., \( \mathfrak{c}^{\max(v, u_1)} = \mathfrak{c} \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We begin by expressing the continuum cardinality \( \mathfrak{c} \) as \( 2^{\aleph_0} \). Using the property that lifting the exponentiation of 2 to any cardinal \( a \) results in the exponentiation of 2 to the lifted cardinal \( a \), we have:

\[
\text{Cardinal.lift}(2^{\aleph_0}) = 2^{\text{Cardinal.lift}(\aleph_0)}
\]

Next, we use the fact that lifting \( \aleph_0 \) to any universe level results in \( \aleph_0 \) itself:

\[
\text{Cardinal.lift}(\aleph_0) = \aleph_0
\]

Thus, we get:

\[
2^{\text{Cardinal.lift}(\aleph_0)} = 2^{\aleph_0}
\]

Finally, we recognize that \( 2^{\aleph_0} \) is equal to \( \mathfrak{c} \):

\[
2^{\aleph_0} = \mathfrak{c}
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
\text{Cardinal.lift}(\mathfrak{c}) = \mathfrak{c}
\]

This completes the proof that the lift of the continuum cardinality to any higher universe is equal to the continuum cardinality itself.
