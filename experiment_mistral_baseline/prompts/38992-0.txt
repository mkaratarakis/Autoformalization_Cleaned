1. **Informal Theorem**  
If-then-else Identity: $(\text{if } c \text{ then } t \text{ else } t) = t$ : For any proposition $c$ and any type $\alpha$, if $c$ is decidable, then the if-then-else expression `if c then t else t` is equal to $t$ for any element $t \in \alpha$. In other words, $(\text{if } c \text{ then } t \text{ else } t) = t$.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We need to show that the if-then-else expression $(\text{if } c \text{ then } t \text{ else } t)$ is equal to $t$ for any element $t \in \alpha$. We discuss by cases based on the condition $c$:

1. **Case 1: $c$ is true.**
- In this case, the expression $(\text{if } c \text{ then } t \text{ else } t)$ simplifies to $t$.
- Therefore, we need to show that $t = t$.
- This is trivially true due to the reflexive property of equality.

2. **Case 2: $c$ is false.**
- In this case, the expression $(\text{if } c \text{ then } t \text{ else } t)$ simplifies to $t$.
- Therefore, we need to show that $t = t$.
- This is also trivially true due to the reflexive property of equality.

Since both cases are trivially true, we conclude that $(\text{if } c \text{ then } t \text{ else } t) = t$ for any element $t \in \alpha$. This completes the proof. $\blacksquare$
