1. **Informal Theorem**  
Stability of Generalised Continued Fraction Approximations at Next Step Under Termination : For any division ring \( K \), a sequence \( s \) of pairs \((a_i, b_i)\) in \( K \), and a natural number \( n \), if the sequence \( s \) terminates at position \( n \), then the approximation of the generalised continued fraction up to position \( n + 1 \) is equal to the approximation up to position \( n \). In other words, if \( s \) terminates at \( n \), then \( \text{convs'Aux}(s, n + 1) = \text{convs'Aux}(s, n) \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We need to show that if the sequence \( s \) terminates at position \( n \), then the approximation of the generalised continued fraction up to position \( n + 1 \) is equal to the approximation up to position \( n \).

1. **Base Case:**
- If \( n = 0 \), the sequence \( s \) terminates at position \( 0 \). This means the first element of \( s \) is `none`.
- By the definition of `convs'Aux`, the approximation at position \( 0 \) is \( 0 \).
- Therefore, the approximation at position \( 0 + 1 \) is also \( 0 \), and the base case is proved.

2. **Inductive Step:**
- Assume the statement holds for \( n \). That is, if the sequence \( s \) terminates at position \( n \), then \( \text{convs'Aux}(s, n + 1) = \text{convs'Aux}(s, n) \).
- We need to show that if the sequence \( s \) terminates at position \( n + 1 \), then \( \text{convs'Aux}(s, n + 1 + 1) = \text{convs'Aux}(s, n + 1) \).

3. **Case Analysis:**
- **Case 1: The head of the sequence \( s \) is `none`:**
- If the head of \( s \) is `none`, the sequence \( s \) terminates at position \( 0 \).
- By the definition of `convs'Aux`, the approximation at position \( 0 \) is \( 0 \).
- Therefore, the approximation at position \( 0 + 1 \) is also \( 0 \), and the case is proved.
- **Case 2: The head of the sequence \( s \) is `some gp_head`:**
- If the head of \( s \) is `some gp_head`, we need to show that the approximation of the generalised continued fraction up to position \( n + 1 + 1 \) is equal to the approximation up to position \( n + 1 \).
- We show that the tail of the sequence \( s \) terminates at position \( n \).
- Using the inductive hypothesis, we have \( \text{convs'Aux}(s_{\text{tail}}, n + 1) = \text{convs'Aux}(s_{\text{tail}}, n) \).
- By the definition of `convs'Aux`, the approximation at position \( n + 1 + 1 \) is equal to the approximation at position \( n + 1 \).

Thus, by induction, the theorem is proved. \(\blacksquare\)
