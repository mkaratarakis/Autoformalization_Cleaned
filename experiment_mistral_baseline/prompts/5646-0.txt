1. **Informal Theorem**  
Integral Element Under Algebra Homomorphism: \( \text{IsIntegral}(R, b) \to \text{IsIntegral}(R, f(b)) \) : For any commutative rings \( R \) and \( A \), and any rings \( B \) and \( C \) with algebra structures over \( R \) and \( A \), if \( b \) is an integral element in \( B \) over \( R \) and \( f : A \to B \to C \) is an algebra homomorphism, then \( f(b) \) is also an integral element in \( C \) over \( R \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
Let \( b \) be an integral element in \( B \) over \( R \). By definition, there exists a monic polynomial \( P \) in \( R[X] \) such that \( P(b) = 0 \).

To show that \( f(b) \) is integral over \( R \), we need to find a monic polynomial \( P \) in \( R[X] \) such that \( P(f(b)) = 0 \). We already have \( P \) as a monic polynomial from the assumption.

We start by rewriting the goal using the definition of the algebra evaluation map \( \text{aeval} \). Then, we use the fact that the polynomial \( P \) can be mapped through the algebra map from \( R \) to \( A \) without changing its evaluation. Next, we apply the property of the algebra homomorphism \( f \) that \( \text{aeval}(f(b), P) = f(\text{aeval}(b, P)) \). Since \( P(b) = 0 \) by the assumption, we have \( \text{aeval}(b, P) = 0 \). Finally, since \( f \) is a homomorphism, \( f(0) = 0 \), thus completing the proof.

Therefore, \( f(b) \) is integral over \( R \).
