1. **Informal Theorem**  
Existence of Equipartitions with Given Number of Parts : For any finite set \( s \) of type \( \alpha \) with decidable equality, and for any natural number \( n \) such that \( n \neq 0 \) and \( n \leq |s| \), there exists a finite partition \( P \) of \( s \) such that \( P \) is an equipartition and the number of parts in \( P \) is exactly \( n \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
First, note that \( n \neq 0 \) is equivalent to \( 0 < n \). Given \( 0 < n \leq |s| \), we need to show the existence of a partition \( P \) of \( s \) such that \( P \) is an equipartition and \( |P| = n \).

We start by constructing a partition \( P \) by equitabilising the indiscrete partition of \( s \). This partition \( P \) is an equipartition by construction. To show that \( |P| = n \), we use the fact that the number of parts in the equitabilised partition is given by \( n - |s| \% n + |s| \% n \). Using the identity for subtraction and addition cancellation, we conclude that the number of parts is \( n \).

Thus, we have shown the existence of a partition \( P \) of \( s \) such that \( P \) is an equipartition and \( |P| = n \).
