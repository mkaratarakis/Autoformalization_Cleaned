1. **Informal Theorem**  
Distance of a Natural Number to Itself is Zero: \( \text{dist}(n, n) = 0 \) : For any natural number \( n \), the distance between \( n \) and itself is zero, i.e., \( \text{dist}(n, n) = 0 \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that the distance between a natural number \( n \) and itself is zero, we start by using the definition of the distance function \( \text{dist}(a, b) \). The distance function is defined in terms of truncated subtraction, which is the subtraction operation in a canonically ordered commutative monoid. Specifically, \( \text{dist}(a, b) = a - b \).

We need to show that \( \text{dist}(n, n) = 0 \). By the definition of the distance function, this is equivalent to showing that \( n - n = 0 \).

Using the property of subtraction in a canonically ordered commutative monoid, we know that for any element \( a \), \( a - a = 0 \). Therefore, \( n - n = 0 \).

Thus, \( \text{dist}(n, n) = 0 \), which completes the proof.
