1. **Informal Theorem**  
Right Triangle Inequality for Distance in Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \( n \) and \( m \), it holds that \( n \leq m + \text{dist}(n, m) \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by noting the symmetry of the distance function, which states that for any natural numbers \( n \) and \( m \), \(\text{dist}(n, m) = \text{dist}(m, n)\). Therefore, the goal of showing \( n \leq m + \text{dist}(n, m) \) is equivalent to showing \( n \leq m + \text{dist}(m, n) \).

To prove \( n \leq m + \text{dist}(m, n) \), we consider the definition of the distance function on natural numbers. The distance function \(\text{dist}(m, n)\) is defined as the absolute value of the difference between \( m \) and \( n \), i.e., \(\text{dist}(m, n) = |m - n|\).

We have two cases to consider:
1. **Case 1: \( m \geq n \)**
- In this case, \(\text{dist}(m, n) = m - n\).
- Therefore, \( m + \text{dist}(m, n) = m + (m - n) = 2m - n \).
- Since \( m \geq n \), it follows that \( 2m - n \geq n \), which simplifies to \( n \leq 2m - n \).
- Hence, \( n \leq m + \text{dist}(m, n) \).

2. **Case 2: \( m < n \)**
- In this case, \(\text{dist}(m, n) = n - m\).
- Therefore, \( m + \text{dist}(m, n) = m + (n - m) = n \).
- Clearly, \( n \leq n \).

In both cases, we have shown that \( n \leq m + \text{dist}(m, n) \). Therefore, the theorem holds for any natural numbers \( n \) and \( m \). This completes the proof.
