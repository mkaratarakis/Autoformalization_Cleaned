1. **Informal Theorem**  
Distance Equals Subtraction When \( n \leq m \) in Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \( n \) and \( m \), if \( n \leq m \), then the distance between \( n \) and \( m \) is equal to \( m - n \), i.e., \( \text{dist}(n, m) = m - n \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that \( \text{dist}(n, m) = m - n \) for natural numbers \( n \) and \( m \) where \( n \leq m \), we start by using the definition of the distance function on natural numbers. The distance function is defined as:
\[
\text{dist}(n, m) = n - m + (m - n)
\]
Given that \( n \leq m \), we know from the property of natural numbers that \( n - m = 0 \). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\text{dist}(n, m) = 0 + (m - n)
\]
Using the property that adding zero to any number does not change the number, we have:
\[
0 + (m - n) = m - n
\]
Thus, we have shown that:
\[
\text{dist}(n, m) = m - n
\]
This completes the proof.
