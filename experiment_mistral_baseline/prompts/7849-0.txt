1. **Informal Theorem**  
Left Triangle Inequality for Distance in Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \( n \) and \( m \), it holds that \( n \leq \text{dist}(n, m) + m \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start with the goal of proving that for any natural numbers \( n \) and \( m \), \( n \leq \text{dist}(n, m) + m \).

1. **Symmetry of Distance Function:**
Since the distance function is symmetric, we have:
\[
\text{dist}(n, m) = \text{dist}(m, n)
\]
Therefore, the goal \( n \leq \text{dist}(n, m) + m \) can be rewritten as:
\[
n \leq \text{dist}(m, n) + m
\]

2. **Definition of Distance Function:**
The distance function \(\text{dist}(m, n)\) is defined as the truncated subtraction \(|m - n|\), which is the non-negative difference between \(m\) and \(n\). This means:
\[
\text{dist}(m, n) = |m - n|
\]

3. **Case Analysis:**
We consider two cases based on the values of \(m\) and \(n\):
- **Case 1: \(m \geq n\):**
In this case, \(\text{dist}(m, n) = m - n\). Substituting this into the goal, we get:
\[
n \leq (m - n) + m
\]
Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[
n \leq m - n + m = 2m - n
\]
Since \(m \geq n\), we have \(2m - n \geq n\). Therefore, the inequality \(n \leq 2m - n\) holds.

- **Case 2: \(m < n\):**
In this case, \(\text{dist}(m, n) = n - m\). Substituting this into the goal, we get:
\[
n \leq (n - m) + m
\]
Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[
n \leq n - m + m = n
\]
The inequality \(n \leq n\) is trivially true.

Since both cases hold, we conclude that for any natural numbers \( n \) and \( m \), the inequality \( n \leq \text{dist}(n, m) + m \) is true. This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
