Below are the error message and proof state for the proof you generated. Please revise the proof accordingly starting with new prefix. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
6. **Error Message and Proof State**
tmp.lean:9:9: error: unsolved goals
case zero
b c : Nat
a0 : 0 < zero
⊢ zero * b < zero * c ↔ b < c
tmp.lean:9:2: error: alternative 'succ' has not been provided
case zero
b c : Nat
a0 : 0 < zero
⊢ zero * b < zero * c ↔ b < c

4. **New Prefix**  
   The initial Lean 4 code that you must build on.
import Init.Omega
import Init.Data.Nat.Mod

open Nat


example (a0 : 0 < a) : a * b < a * c ↔ b < c := by
  induction a using Nat.rec with
  | zero =>
    -- Base case: a = 0
    -- The assumption 0 < 0 is false, so the implication is trivially true.
