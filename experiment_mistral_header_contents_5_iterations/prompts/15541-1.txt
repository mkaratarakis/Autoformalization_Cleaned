  ?x % (?a * ?b) = ?x % ?a + ?a * (?x / ?a % ?b)
with
  x % (a * b) = a * (x / a % b) + x % a
a b x : Nat
⊢ x % (a * b) = a * (x / a % b) + x % a
tmp.lean:7:65: error: unsolved goals

h1 : x % (a * b) = a * (x / a % b) + x % a
⊢ a * (x / a % b) + x % a = x % a + a * (x / a % b)
Please revise the proof accordingly - but always pick up exactly where the given prefix ends. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
