The previous lean 4 proof has the following errors. 
6. **Error Message**
tmp.lean:10:19: error: failed to solve universe constraint
  max (max u_1 v) ?u.136 =?= u_1
while trying to unify
  lift.{max u_1 v, u_1} 𝔠 : Cardinal.{max u_1 v}
with
  lift.{max u_1 v, max u_1 v} 𝔠 : Cardinal.{max u_1 v}
tmp.lean:7:0: error: (kernel) application type mismatch
  Eq continuum
argument has type
  Cardinal.{u_1}
but function has type

Please revise the proof accordingly - but always pick up exactly where the given prefix ends. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
