The previous lean 4 proof has the following errors. 
6. **Error Message**
tmp.lean:11:4: error: type mismatch
  Nat.le_add_right n (n - m)
has type
  n ≤ n + (n - m) : Prop
but is expected to have type
  n ≤ m + (n - m) : Prop
tmp.lean:14:25: error: type mismatch
  Eq.symm (add_tsub_cancel_of_le (le_of_not_le h))
has type
  m = n + (m - n) : Prop
but is expected to have type
  n = m + (n - m) : Prop
tmp.lean:17:9: error: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression
  ?m.3488 + (?m.3489 - ?m.3488)
case neg.calc.step
n m : ℕ
h : ¬m ≤ n
⊢ m + (m - n + (n - m)) ≤ m + (m - n)
Please revise the proof accordingly - but always pick up exactly where the given prefix ends. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
