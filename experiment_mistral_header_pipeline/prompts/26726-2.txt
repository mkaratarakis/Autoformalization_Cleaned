The previous lean 4 proof has the following errors. 
6. **Error Message**
tmp.lean:12:24: error: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression
  ?x / ?y + ?z
a b : ℕ
ha : 4 = 0 ∧ a = 1 ∨ 1 < 4 ∧ ∃ k, a = 4 * k + 1
hb : Odd b
⊢ Odd a
tmp.lean:20:8: error: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression
  ?m.1509 - ?m.1508 = ?m.1510

ha : a % 4 = 1

⊢ (-1) ^ ((a - 1) / 2 * (b - 1) / 2) = 1
tmp.lean:25:6: error: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression
  (-1) ^ ((a - 1) / 2 * (b - 1) / 2)
a b : ℕ

this : (-1) ^ ((a - 1) / 2 * (b - 1) / 2) = 1
⊢ (-1) ^ (a / 2 * (b / 2)) * J(↑b | a) = J(↑b | a)
Please revise the proof accordingly - but always pick up exactly where the given prefix ends. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
