The previous lean 4 proof has the following errors. 
6. **Error Message**
tmp.lean:11:4: error: type mismatch
  Nat.le_add_right ?m.128 ?m.129
has type
  ?m.128 ≤ ?m.128 + ?m.129 : Prop
but is expected to have type
  n ≤ m + (n - m) : Prop
tmp.lean:12:8: error: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression
  n.dist m
case neg
n m : ℕ
h : ¬m ≤ n
⊢ n ≤ m + m.dist n
Please revise the proof accordingly - but always pick up exactly where the given prefix ends. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
