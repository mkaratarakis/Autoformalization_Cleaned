example (as bs : List α) (h : i < as.length) {h'} : (as ++ bs)[i] = as[i] := by
  induction as generalizing i
  case nil =>
    -- Base case: as = []
    -- The goal is to show that ([] ++ bs)[i] = [][i]
    -- Since the empty list has no elements, the index i must be out of bounds
    -- The goal is trivially true
