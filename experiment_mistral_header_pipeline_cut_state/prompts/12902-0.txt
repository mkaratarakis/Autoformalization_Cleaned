1. **Informal Theorem**  
Count of Elements Satisfying Predicate is Less Than or Equal to List Length: \(\text{countP}(p, l) \leq \text{length}(l)\) : For any type \( \alpha \) and any predicate \( p : \alpha \to \text{Bool} \), the number of elements in a list \( l \) that satisfy \( p \) is less than or equal to the length of the list \( l \). Mathematically, this is expressed as \( \text{countP}(p, l) \leq \text{length}(l) \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by using the theorem that the count of elements in a list \( l \) that satisfy a predicate \( p \) is equal to the length of the filtered list. This theorem states:
\[
\text{countP}(p, l) = \text{length}(\text{filter} \, p \, l)
\]
Thus, the proposition we need to prove, \(\text{countP}(p, l) \leq \text{length}(l)\), can be simplified to:
\[
\text{length}(\text{filter} \, p \, l) \leq \text{length}(l)
\]
Next, we use the theorem that the length of the filtered list is less than or equal to the length of the original list. This theorem states:
\[
\text{length}(\text{filter} \, p \, l) \leq \text{length}(l)
\]
Since this theorem is already known to be true, the proof is complete. Therefore, we have shown that:
\[
\text{countP}(p, l) \leq \text{length}(l)
\]
This completes the proof.
