1. **Informal Theorem**  
Count of Element in Cons List: \(\text{count}(a, a :: l) = \text{count}(a, l) + 1\) : For any type \( \alpha \) with a `BEq` instance and a `LawfulBEq` instance, and for any element \( a \) of type \( \alpha \) and any list \( l \) of elements of type \( \alpha \), the count of \( a \) in the list \( a :: l \) (i.e., the list formed by adding \( a \) to the front of \( l \)) is equal to the count of \( a \) in \( l \) plus one. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[
\text{count}(a, a :: l) = \text{count}(a, l) + 1
\]

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the theorem, we start by using the definition of the count function for lists. According to the definition, the count of \(a\) in the list \(a :: l\) is given by:
\[
\text{count}(a, a :: l) = \text{count}(a, l) + \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } a = a \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
Since \(a = a\) is always true, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\text{count}(a, a :: l) = \text{count}(a, l) + 1
\]
Thus, the theorem is proved. \(\blacksquare\)
