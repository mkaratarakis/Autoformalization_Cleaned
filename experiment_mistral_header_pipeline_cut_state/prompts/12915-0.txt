1. **Informal Theorem**  
Count of Element in List Concatenated with Itself Increases by One : For any type \( \alpha \) with a `BEq` instance and a `LawfulBEq` instance, and for any element \( a \in \alpha \) and list \( l \) of elements of type \( \alpha \), the number of occurrences of \( a \) in the list \( l \) concatenated with \( a \) (i.e., \( l ++ [a] \)) is equal to the number of occurrences of \( a \) in \( l \) plus one. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[
\text{count}(a, l \text{.concat } a) = \text{count}(a, l) + 1
\]

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the theorem, we start by noting that the concatenation of an element \( a \) to a list \( l \) is equivalent to appending \( a \) as a singleton list to \( l \). Formally, this is expressed as:
\[
l.concat(a) = l ++ [a]
\]
Next, we use the properties of the `count` function, which counts the number of occurrences of an element in a list. Specifically, the `count` function satisfies the property that the number of occurrences of \( a \) in \( l ++ [a] \) is the sum of the number of occurrences of \( a \) in \( l \) and the number of occurrences of \( a \) in the singleton list \([a]\). Since the singleton list \([a]\) contains exactly one occurrence of \( a \), we have:
\[
\text{count}(a, l ++ [a]) = \text{count}(a, l) + \text{count}(a, [a])
\]
Given that \(\text{count}(a, [a]) = 1\), we can simplify the above equation to:
\[
\text{count}(a, l ++ [a]) = \text{count}(a, l) + 1
\]
Thus, we have shown that:
\[
\text{count}(a, l \text{.concat } a) = \text{count}(a, l) + 1
\]
This completes the proof.
