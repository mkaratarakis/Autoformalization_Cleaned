1. **Informal Theorem**  
Sublist Count Preservation: \(\text{countP}(p, l_1) \leq \text{countP}(p, l_2)\) for \( l_1 \subseteq l_2 \) : For any type \(\alpha\) and any predicate \( p : \alpha \to \text{Bool} \), if \( l_1 \) is a sublist of \( l_2 \), then the number of elements in \( l_1 \) that satisfy \( p \) is less than or equal to the number of elements in \( l_2 \) that satisfy \( p \). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[
l_1 \subseteq l_2 \implies \text{countP}(p, l_1) \leq \text{countP}(p, l_2)
\]

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by noting that the count of elements in a list that satisfy a predicate \( p \) is equal to the length of the filtered list. Therefore, the goal is to show that the length of the filtered list \( \text{filter}(p, l_1) \) is less than or equal to the length of the filtered list \( \text{filter}(p, l_2) \).

Since \( l_1 \) is a sublist of \( l_2 \), we can use the property that if \( l_1 \) is a sublist of \( l_2 \), then the length of \( l_1 \) is less than or equal to the length of \( l_2 \). Applying this property to the filtered lists, we get:
\[
\text{length}(\text{filter}(p, l_1)) \leq \text{length}(\text{filter}(p, l_2))
\]

Thus, we have shown that:
\[
\text{countP}(p, l_1) \leq \text{countP}(p, l_2)
\]

This completes the proof.
