1. **Informal Theorem**  
Positive Count of Element in List if and only if Element is in List: \( 0 < \text{count}(a, l) \iff a \in l \) : For any type \( \alpha \) with a `BEq` instance and a `LawfulBEq` instance, and for any element \( a \in \alpha \) and list \( l \) of elements of type \( \alpha \), the count of \( a \) in \( l \) is positive if and only if \( a \) is a member of \( l \). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[
0 < \text{count}(a, l) \iff a \in l
\]

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the theorem, we start by using the definitions and properties of the functions and relations involved. Specifically, we use the following:

1. **Definition of `count`**: The function `count a l` returns the number of occurrences of \( a \) in the list \( l \).
2. **Property `countP_pos`**: The count of \( a \) in \( l \) is positive if and only if there exists an element \( a' \) in \( l \) such that \( a = a' \).
3. **Property `beq_iff_eq`**: The boolean equality \( a == b \) is `true` if and only if \( a = b \).
4. **Property `exists_eq_right`**: The statement \( \exists a, p(a) \land a = a' \) is logically equivalent to \( p(a') \).

Using these properties, we can simplify the proposition \( 0 < \text{count}(a, l) \iff a \in l \) as follows:

- **Forward direction**: If \( 0 < \text{count}(a, l) \), then by `countP_pos`, there exists an element \( a' \) in \( l \) such that \( a = a' \). By `beq_iff_eq`, this means \( a \) is a member of \( l \).
- **Backward direction**: If \( a \in l \), then there exists an element \( a' \) in \( l \) such that \( a = a' \). By `countP_pos`, this implies \( 0 < \text{count}(a, l) \).

Thus, we have shown that \( 0 < \text{count}(a, l) \) if and only if \( a \in l \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
