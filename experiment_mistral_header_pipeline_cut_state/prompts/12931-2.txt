4. **New Prefix**  
   The initial Lean 4 code that you must build on.
import Init.Data.List.Sublist

open List
open Nat
variable (p q : α → Bool)
variable {p q}
variable [BEq α]
variable [LawfulBEq α]

example (l : List α) (a : α) : l.filter (· == a) = replicate (count a l) a := by
  induction l with

    simp [filter, replicate]
  | cons h t ih =>
