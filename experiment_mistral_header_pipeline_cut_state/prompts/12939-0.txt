1. **Informal Theorem**  
Count of Element in List After Erasing Itself Decreases by One : For any list \( l \) of elements of type \( \alpha \) and any element \( a \in \alpha \), the number of occurrences of \( a \) in the list obtained by erasing the first occurrence of \( a \) from \( l \) is equal to the number of occurrences of \( a \) in \( l \) minus 1. Formally, for any \( a \in \alpha \) and list \( l \):
\[ \text{count}(a, \text{erase}(a, l)) = \text{count}(a, l) - 1 \]

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by using the theorem that the count of an element \( a \) in a list \( l \) after erasing another element \( b \) is equal to the count of \( a \) in \( l \) minus 1 if \( a = b \), and equal to the count of \( a \) in \( l \) otherwise. This theorem simplifies our goal to:
\[ \text{count}(a, l) - \text{if } (a == a) = \text{true} \text{ then } 1 \text{ else } 0 = \text{count}(a, l) - 1 \]

Since the boolean equality \( a == a \) is true, the if-then-else expression \(\text{if } (a == a) = \text{true} \text{ then } 1 \text{ else } 0\) simplifies to 1. Therefore, our goal becomes:
\[ \text{count}(a, l) - 1 = \text{count}(a, l) - 1 \]

This equality is trivially true by the properties of equality. Hence, the number of occurrences of \( a \) in the list obtained by erasing the first occurrence of \( a \) from \( l \) is indeed equal to the number of occurrences of \( a \) in \( l \) minus 1. This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
