1. **Informal Theorem**  
Count of Element Equals List Length if and Only if All Elements are Equal: \(\text{count}(a, l) = \text{length}(l) \leftrightarrow \forall b \in l, b = a\) : For any type \(\alpha\) with a `BEq` instance and a `LawfulBEq` instance, and for any element \(a \in \alpha\) and list \(l\) of elements of \(\alpha\), the number of occurrences of \(a\) in \(l\) is equal to the length of \(l\) if and only if every element in \(l\) is equal to \(a\). In other words, \(\text{count}(a, l) = \text{length}(l) \leftrightarrow \forall b \in l, b = a\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by using the definition of `List.count` and the equivalence `List.countP_eq_length`. The definition of `List.count` states that \(\text{count}(a, l)\) is the number of elements in \(l\) that are equal to \(a\). The equivalence `List.countP_eq_length` states that the number of elements in \(l\) that satisfy a predicate \( p \) is equal to the length of \(l\) if and only if every element in \(l\) satisfies \( p \). Therefore, our goal is to show that for all \( a_1 \in l \), \( a_1 == a \) is true if and only if for all \( b \in l \), \( b = a \).

To prove this equivalence, we need to show both directions:

1. **(\(\Rightarrow\))**: Assume that for all \( a_1 \in l \), \( a_1 == a \) is true. We need to show that for all \( b \in l \), \( b = a \).
- Let \( b \in l \).
- By the assumption, \( b == a \) is true.
- By the property of boolean equality, \( b == a \) being true implies \( b = a \).
- Therefore, for all \( b \in l \), \( b = a \).

2. **(\(\Leftarrow\))**: Assume that for all \( b \in l \), \( b = a \). We need to show that for all \( a_1 \in l \), \( a_1 == a \) is true.
- Let \( a_1 \in l \).
- By the assumption, \( a_1 = a \).
- By the property of boolean equality, \( a_1 = a \) implies \( a_1 == a \) is true.
- Therefore, for all \( a_1 \in l \), \( a_1 == a \) is true.

Since both directions are proven, we conclude that \(\text{count}(a, l) = \text{length}(l) \leftrightarrow \forall b \in l, b = a\). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
