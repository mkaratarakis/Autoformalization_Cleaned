1. **Informal Theorem**  
Swapping Comparison Results in Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \( a \) and \( b \), the result of swapping the comparison between \( a \) and \( b \) is the same as the comparison between \( b \) and \( a \). In other words, if \( \text{compare}(a, b) \) returns an ordering, then \( \text{compare}(a, b). \text{swap} \) is equal to \( \text{compare}(b, a) \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by using the definition of the comparison function for natural numbers, which states:
\[
\text{compare}(a, b) =
\begin{cases}
\text{Ordering.eq} & \text{if } a \le b \text{ and } b \le a \\
\text{Ordering.lt} & \text{if } a \le b \text{ and } \neg b \le a \\
\text{Ordering.gt} & \text{if } \neg a \le b
\end{cases}
\]
We need to show that:
\[
\text{compare}(a, b). \text{swap} = \text{compare}(b, a)
\]
We will discuss by cases based on the conditions \(a \le b\) and \(b \le a\).

1. **Case 1:** \(a \le b\) and \(b \le a\)
- In this case, \(\text{compare}(a, b) = \text{Ordering.eq}\).
- Therefore, \(\text{compare}(a, b). \text{swap} = \text{Ordering.eq.swap} = \text{Ordering.eq}\).
- Since \(\text{compare}(b, a) = \text{Ordering.eq}\), the equality holds trivially.

2. **Case 2:** \(a \le b\) and \(\neg b \le a\)
- In this case, \(\text{compare}(a, b) = \text{Ordering.lt}\).
- Therefore, \(\text{compare}(a, b). \text{swap} = \text{Ordering.lt.swap} = \text{Ordering.gt}\).
- Since \(\text{compare}(b, a) = \text{Ordering.gt}\), the equality holds trivially.

3. **Case 3:** \(\neg a \le b\) and \(b \le a\)
- In this case, \(\text{compare}(a, b) = \text{Ordering.gt}\).
- Therefore, \(\text{compare}(a, b). \text{swap} = \text{Ordering.gt.swap} = \text{Ordering.lt}\).
- Since \(\text{compare}(b, a) = \text{Ordering.lt}\), the equality holds trivially.

4. **Case 4:** \(\neg a \le b\) and \(\neg b \le a\)
- In this case, \(\text{compare}(a, b) = \text{Ordering.gt}\).
- Therefore, \(\text{compare}(a, b). \text{swap} = \text{Ordering.gt.swap} = \text{Ordering.gt}\).
- Since \(\text{compare}(b, a) = \text{Ordering.gt}\), the equality holds trivially.

In each case, the equality \(\text{compare}(a, b). \text{swap} = \text{compare}(b, a)\) holds due to the reflexive property of equality. This completes the proof.
