1. **Informal Theorem**  
Heterogeneous Equality from Equality and Recursion : For any types \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \), and for any elements \( a : \alpha \) and \( b : \beta \), if \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are equal (i.e., \( \alpha = \beta \)), and if the result of applying the `Eq.rec` function to \( a \) and the equality \( \alpha = \beta \) is equal to \( b \) (i.e., \( \text{Eq.rec}(a, \alpha = \beta) = b \)), then \( a \) and \( b \) are heterogeneously equal (i.e., \( \text{HEq}(a, b) \)).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start with the assumption that \( \alpha = \beta \). Using this equality, we can substitute \( \beta \) with \( \alpha \) in the goal and the hypothesis. This simplifies the goal to showing \( \text{HEq} \, a \, b \) where \( b \) is now of type \( \alpha \).

Next, we use the theorem that if \( a \) and \( b \) are equal within the same type \( \alpha \), then they are also heterogeneously equal. Therefore, to prove \( \text{HEq} \, a \, b \), it suffices to show that \( a = b \).

Finally, the hypothesis \( \text{Eq.rec}(a, \alpha = \beta) = b \) directly proves that \( a = b \). Hence, \( a \) and \( b \) are heterogeneously equal. This completes the proof.
