1. **Informal Theorem**  
Range of Successor Equals Prepend Zero to Map of Successor on Range : For any natural number \( n \), the list generated by `List.range (n + 1)` is equal to the list obtained by prepending 0 to the list of the successors of the elements in `List.range n`. Formally, this can be written as:
\[ \text{List.range}(n + 1) = 0 :: \text{List.map}(\text{Nat.succ})(\text{List.range}(n)) \]

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by using the theorem that the list generated by \(\text{List.range}(n)\) is equal to the list generated by \(\text{List.range}'(0, n)\). This allows us to rewrite the goal:
\[ \text{List.range}(n + 1) = 0 :: \text{List.map}(\text{Nat.succ})(\text{List.range}(n)) \]
as:
\[ \text{List.range}'(0, n + 1) = 0 :: \text{List.map}(\text{Nat.succ})(\text{List.range}'(0, n)) \]

Next, we use the definition of \(\text{List.range}'\), which states that \(\text{List.range}'(s, n + 1, step)\) is the list \([s, s + step, \ldots, s + (n \cdot step)]\). Applying this definition, we get:
\[ \text{List.range}'(0, n + 1) = 0 :: \text{List.range}'(1, n) \]

We then use the commutativity of addition to rewrite \(1 + 0\) as \(0 + 1\):
\[ 0 :: \text{List.range}'(1, n) = 0 :: \text{List.range}'(0 + 1, n) \]

Finally, we use the theorem that mapping the function \(x \mapsto a + x\) over the list \(\text{List.range}'(s, n, step)\) is equal to the list \(\text{List.range}'(a + s, n, step)\). Specifically, for \(a = 1\), \(s = 0\), and \(step = 1\), we have:
\[ \text{List.map}(\text{Nat.succ})(\text{List.range}'(0, n)) = \text{List.range}'(1, n) \]

Thus, our goal is now:
\[ 0 :: \text{List.range}'(1, n) = 0 :: \text{List.map}(\text{Nat.succ})(\text{List.range}'(0, n)) \]

To prove this equality, we use the congruence theorem, which states that if the heads of two lists are equal and the tails are equal, then the lists are equal. The heads of both lists are \(0\), so we need to show that the tails are equal:
\[ \text{List.range}'(1, n) = \text{List.map}(\text{Nat.succ})(\text{List.range}'(0, n)) \]

We use the function extensionality theorem, which states that two functions are equal if they map equal inputs to equal outputs. Specifically, we use the commutativity of addition to show that the function \(x \mapsto 1 + x\) is equal to the function \(\text{Nat.succ}\):
\[ \text{Nat.succ}(x) = 1 + x \]

Therefore, the tails of the lists are equal, and the original goal is proved. This completes the proof.
