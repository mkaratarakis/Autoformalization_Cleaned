1. **Informal Theorem**  
Range List has No Duplicates: \(\text{Nodup}(\text{range}(n))\) : For any natural number \( n \), the list of natural numbers from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \) generated by `List.range n` has no duplicate elements, i.e., \(\text{Nodup}(\text{range}(n))\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that the list `List.range n` has no duplicate elements for any natural number \( n \), we use the following steps:

1. **Simplify the Proposition:**
We know from the definition that the list generated by `List.range n` is equal to the list generated by `List.range' 0 n`. Specifically, `List.range n` returns the list of natural numbers from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \) in increasing order, and `List.range' 0 n` returns the same list.

2. **Use the Nodup Property:**
We also know that the list `List.range' 0 n` has no duplicate elements. Therefore, by the transitivity of equality, the list `List.range n` must also have no duplicate elements.

Since the list `List.range n` is equal to the list `List.range' 0 n` and the latter has no duplicate elements, it follows that the list `List.range n` has no duplicate elements. This completes the proof.
