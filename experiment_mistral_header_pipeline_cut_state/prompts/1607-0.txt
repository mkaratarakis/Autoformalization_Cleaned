1. **Informal Theorem**  
Length of Iota List Equals \( n \) : For any natural number \( n \), the length of the list of natural numbers from \( n \) down to 1 in decreasing order, denoted as \(\text{iota}(n)\), is equal to \( n \). In other words, \(\text{length}(\text{iota}(n)) = n\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that the length of \(\text{iota}(n)\) is \( n \), we use the fact that \(\text{iota}(n)\) is equal to the reverse of the list of natural numbers starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 for \( n \) times, denoted as \(\text{range}'(1, n)\). Therefore, we need to show that the length of \(\text{reverse}(\text{range}'(1, n))\) is equal to \( n \).

Since the length of a list is preserved under the reverse operation, the length of \(\text{reverse}(\text{range}'(1, n))\) is the same as the length of \(\text{range}'(1, n)\). The list \(\text{range}'(1, n)\) contains exactly \( n \) elements, starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 up to \( n \). Hence, the length of \(\text{range}'(1, n)\) is \( n \).

Thus, the length of \(\text{iota}(n)\) is also \( n \). This completes the proof.
