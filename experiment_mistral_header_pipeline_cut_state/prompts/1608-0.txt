1. **Informal Theorem**  
Membership in List of Natural Numbers from \( n \) to 1 : For any natural numbers \( m \) and \( n \), \( m \) is a member of the list \( \text{iota}(n) \) if and only if \( 1 \leq m \leq n \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the theorem, we start by using the fact that \(\text{iota}(n)\) is the reverse of the list \(\text{range}'(1, n)\). This means that \(\text{iota}(n)\) is the list of natural numbers from \( n \) down to 1 in decreasing order, which is the reverse of the list of natural numbers starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 for \( n \) times.

Next, we use the commutativity of addition to simplify the expression. The commutativity of addition states that for any natural numbers \( a \) and \( b \), \( a + b = b + a \).

By simplifying the proposition using these facts, we need to show that \( m \in \text{iota}(n) \) if and only if \( 1 \leq m \leq n \).

Since \(\text{iota}(n)\) is the reverse of \(\text{range}'(1, n)\), and \(\text{range}'(1, n)\) is the list of natural numbers from 1 to \( n \), it follows that \( m \) is in \(\text{iota}(n)\) if and only if \( m \) is in \(\text{range}'(1, n)\).

The list \(\text{range}'(1, n)\) contains all natural numbers \( m \) such that \( 1 \leq m \leq n \). Therefore, \( m \in \text{iota}(n) \) if and only if \( 1 \leq m \leq n \).

This completes the proof.
