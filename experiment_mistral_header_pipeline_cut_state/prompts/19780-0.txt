1. **Informal Theorem**  
Comparison of Natural Numbers: \( \text{compare}(a, b) \) Definition Using Less-Than-or-Equal Relation : For any natural numbers \( a \) and \( b \), the comparison \( \text{compare}(a, b) \) is defined as follows:
- If \( a \le b \) and \( b \le a \), then \( \text{compare}(a, b) = \text{Ordering.eq} \) (i.e., \( a = b \)).
- If \( a \le b \) and \( b \not\le a \), then \( \text{compare}(a, b) = \text{Ordering.lt} \) (i.e., \( a < b \)).
- If \( a \not\le b \), then \( \text{compare}(a, b) = \text{Ordering.gt} \) (i.e., \( a > b \)).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by noting that the assumption that the cardinality of $n$ is zero is equivalent to, and thus can be converted to, $n$ being empty. We need to prove that the determinant of $M$ is $1$.

First, we try to show that $M = 1$ (the identity matrix). To show this, we prove that for every $i \in n$, $M i = 1 i$. However, since $n$ is empty, $M i = 1 i$ holds for every $i \in n$ vacuously. Hence, $M = 1$.

Therefore, the determinant of $M$ is $\det M = \det 1 = 1$. This completes the proof.

### Whole Informal Proof

**Theorem:**
For any natural numbers \( a \) and \( b \), the comparison \( \text{compare}(a, b) \) is defined as follows:
- If \( a \le b \) and \( b \le a \), then \( \text{compare}(a, b) = \text{Ordering.eq} \) (i.e., \( a = b \)).
- If \( a \le b \) and \( b \not\le a \), then \( \text{compare}(a, b) = \text{Ordering.lt} \) (i.e., \( a < b \)).
- If \( a \not\le b \), then \( \text{compare}(a, b) = \text{Ordering.gt} \) (i.e., \( a > b \)).

**Proof:**
We start by using the definition of the comparison function based on strict inequality:
\[
\text{compare}(a, b) = \begin{cases}
\text{Ordering.lt} & \text{if } a < b \\
\text{Ordering.gt} & \text{if } b < a \\
\text{Ordering.eq} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

We then discuss by cases based on the condition \( a \le b \):

1. **Case 1: \( a < b \)**
- Since \( a < b \) implies \( a \le b \), and \( \neg (b \le a) \) is equivalent to \( b < a \), we have:
\[
\text{compare}(a, b) = \text{Ordering.lt}
\]
- The goal simplifies to:
\[
\text{Ordering.lt} = \text{Ordering.lt}
\]
- This is trivially true.

2. **Case 2: \( \neg (a < b) \)**
- We further discuss by cases based on the condition \( b < a \):

- **Subcase 1: \( b < a \)**
- Since \( b < a \) implies \( b \le a \), and \( \neg (a \le b) \) is equivalent to \( a < b \), we have:
\[
\text{compare}(a, b) = \text{Ordering.gt}
\]
- The goal simplifies to:
\[
\text{Ordering.gt} = \text{Ordering.gt}
\]
- This is trivially true.

- **Subcase 2: \( \neg (b < a) \)**
- Since \( \neg (a < b) \) is equivalent to \( b \le a \), and \( \neg (b < a) \) is equivalent to \( a \le b \), we have:
\[
\text{compare}(a, b) = \text{Ordering.eq}
\]
- The goal simplifies to:
\[
\text{Ordering.eq} = \text{Ordering.eq}
\]
- This is trivially true.

Thus, in all cases, the comparison function \( \text{compare}(a, b) \) is correctly defined as specified. This completes the proof.
