1. **Informal Theorem**  
Equality of `range'` and `range'TR` Functions in Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \( \text{start} \), \( \text{len} \), and \( \text{step} \), the function `range'` that generates a list of natural numbers starting from `start` and incrementing by `step` for `len` times is equal to the tail-recursive function `range'TR` that generates the same list. Specifically, `range' start len step` returns the list \([ \text{start}, \text{start} + \text{step}, \ldots, \text{start} + (\text{len} - 1) \cdot \text{step} ]\), and this list is the same as the one returned by `range'TR start len step`.

2. **Informal Proof**  
By the principle of function extensionality, it suffices to show that for all natural numbers \( s \), \( n \), and \( step \) (with \( step \) defaulting to 1), the functions `range'` and `range'TR` yield the same result, i.e., \( \text{range'} s n step = \text{range'TR} s n step \).

For the base case where \( n = 0 \) and any \( m \), simplifying using the definition of `range'TR.go` shows that both `range'` and `range'TR` return an empty list, thus they are equal.

For the inductive case where \( n = n + 1 \) and any \( m \), we proceed to show that the lists generated by `range'` and `range'TR` are equal. Using the definition of `range'TR.go`, we simplify the expressions involved in the lists generated by `range'` and `range'TR`. We rewrite the expressions using the properties of natural number arithmetic: the distributive property of multiplication over addition, associativity of addition, cancellation of subtraction, and right commutativity of addition. The current goal is exactly proved by applying the helper function `go` to \( s \), \( n \), and \( m + 1 \), which establishes the equality of the lists generated by `range'` and `range'TR`.

Thus, we have shown that \( \text{range'} s n step = \text{range'TR} s n step \) for all natural numbers \( s \), \( n \), and \( step \), completing the proof.
