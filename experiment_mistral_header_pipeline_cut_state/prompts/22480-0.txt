1. **Informal Theorem**  
Signed Less Than or Equal To is Negation of Signed Less Than for Bit Vectors: \( x \leq y \leftrightarrow \neg (y < x) \) : For any natural number \( w \) and bit vectors \( x \) and \( y \) of length \( w \), the signed less than or equal to relation \( x \leq y \) is equivalent to the negation of the signed less than relation \( y < x \), i.e., \( x \leq y \) if and only if \( \neg (y < x) \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the theorem, we start by simplifying the goal using the definitions of the signed less than or equal to (`sle`) and signed less than (`slt`) relations for bit vectors. Specifically, we use the following equivalences:
1. The negation of a decision is equivalent to the decision of the negation.
2. The equality of decisions is equivalent to the decision of equality.

After applying these simplifications, the goal reduces to a straightforward arithmetic statement. We then use the `omega` tactic to automatically discharge this arithmetic goal, which completes the proof.

Thus, we have shown that for any natural number \( w \) and bit vectors \( x \) and \( y \) of length \( w \), the signed less than or equal to relation \( x \leq y \) is indeed equivalent to the negation of the signed less than relation \( y < x \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
