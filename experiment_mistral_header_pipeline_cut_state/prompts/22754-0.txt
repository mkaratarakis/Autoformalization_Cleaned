1. **Informal Theorem**  
Subrelation Accessibility: \( q \subseteq r \) and \( \text{Acc}(r, a) \) implies \( \text{Acc}(q, a) \) : For any type \( \alpha \) and relations \( q \) and \( r \) on \( \alpha \), if \( q \) is a subrelation of \( r \) and \( a \) is an accessible element with respect to \( r \), then \( a \) is also accessible with respect to \( q \). In other words, if \( q \subseteq r \) and \( \text{Acc}(r, a) \) holds, then \( \text{Acc}(q, a) \) also holds.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We need to show that if \( q \subseteq r \) and \( a \) is accessible with respect to \( r \), then \( a \) is also accessible with respect to \( q \).

1. **Induction on Accessibility:**
Perform induction on the accessibility of \( r \) and consider the following cases. Let \( x \) be an arbitrary element in \( \alpha \) and assume that for all \( y \) such that \( r y x \), \( y \) is accessible with respect to \( r \). We need to show that \( x \) is accessible with respect to \( q \).

2. **Applying the Accessibility Predicate Constructor:**
To prove that \( x \) is accessible with respect to \( q \), it suffices to show that for all \( y \) such that \( q y x \), \( y \) is accessible with respect to \( q \).

3. **Introducing the Hypothesis:**
Let \( y \) be an arbitrary element in \( \alpha \) and assume that \( q y x \). We need to show that \( y \) is accessible with respect to \( q \).

4. **Using the Subrelation Property:**
Since \( q \subseteq r \), and \( q y x \), we can conclude that \( r y x \). Given that \( ih \) is a proof that for all \( y \) such that \( r y x \), \( y \) is accessible with respect to \( q \), we can conclude that \( y \) is accessible with respect to \( q \).

Therefore, \( a \) is accessible with respect to \( q \), and the proof is complete.
