1. **Informal Theorem**  
Accessibility of Transitive Closure: \( \text{Acc } r \, a \to \text{Acc } (\text{TransGen } r) \, a \) : For any type \( \alpha \) and a relation \( r \) on \( \alpha \), if \( a \) is accessible with respect to \( r \), then \( a \) is also accessible with respect to the transitive closure of \( r \). In other words, if there is no infinite sequence of elements in \( \alpha \) that are related to \( a \) by \( r \), then there is no infinite sequence of elements in \( \alpha \) that are related to \( a \) by the transitive closure of \( r \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We perform induction on the accessibility of \( a \) with respect to \( r \). Let \( x \) be an element in \( \alpha \) such that for every \( y \) in \( \alpha \) with \( r y x \), \( y \) is accessible with respect to \( r \). We need to show that \( x \) is accessible with respect to the transitive closure of \( r \).

To show this, we need to prove that for every \( y \) in \( \alpha \) such that \( \text{TransGen}(r) \, y \, x \) holds, \( y \) is accessible with respect to the transitive closure of \( r \).

1. **Single Step Case:**
- Suppose \( \text{TransGen}(r) \, y \, x \) is a single step, i.e., \( r y x \) holds.
- By the induction hypothesis, \( y \) is accessible with respect to \( r \).
- Therefore, \( y \) is also accessible with respect to the transitive closure of \( r \).

2. **Multi-Step Case:**
- Suppose \( \text{TransGen}(r) \, y \, x \) is a multi-step relation, i.e., there exists some \( z \) in \( \alpha \) such that \( \text{TransGen}(r) \, y \, z \) and \( r z x \) hold.
- By the induction hypothesis, \( z \) is accessible with respect to the transitive closure of \( r \).
- Since \( r z x \) holds, and accessibility is preserved by the relation \( r \), \( y \) is also accessible with respect to the transitive closure of \( r \).

Thus, in both cases, \( y \) is accessible with respect to the transitive closure of \( r \). Therefore, \( x \) is accessible with respect to the transitive closure of \( r \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
