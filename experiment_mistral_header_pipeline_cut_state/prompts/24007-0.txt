1. **Informal Theorem**  
Least Common Multiple with Zero: \(\text{lcm}(0, m) = 0\) : For any natural number \( m \), the least common multiple (LCM) of \( 0 \) and \( m \) is \( 0 \), i.e., \(\text{lcm}(0, m) = 0\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that \(\text{lcm}(0, m) = 0\) for any natural number \( m \), we use the definition of the least common multiple (LCM). The LCM of two numbers \( a \) and \( b \) is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both \( a \) and \( b \). However, when one of the numbers is \( 0 \), the LCM is defined to be \( 0 \) because \( 0 \) is a multiple of any natural number. Therefore, by the definition of LCM, we have \(\text{lcm}(0, m) = 0\). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
