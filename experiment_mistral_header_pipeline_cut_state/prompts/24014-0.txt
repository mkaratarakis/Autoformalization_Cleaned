1. **Informal Theorem**  
LCM Identity: \(\text{lcm}(m, 1) = m\) : For any natural number \( m \), the least common multiple (LCM) of \( m \) and 1 is equal to \( m \), i.e., \(\text{lcm}(m, 1) = m\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that \(\text{lcm}(m, 1) = m\) for any natural number \( m \), we use the definition of the least common multiple (LCM). The LCM of two natural numbers \( a \) and \( b \) is the smallest natural number that is a multiple of both \( a \) and \( b \).

1. By the definition of LCM, \(\text{lcm}(m, 1)\) is the smallest natural number that is a multiple of both \( m \) and 1.
2. Since 1 is a divisor of every natural number, any multiple of \( m \) is also a multiple of 1.
3. Therefore, the smallest multiple of both \( m \) and 1 is \( m \) itself.
4. Hence, \(\text{lcm}(m, 1) = m\).

This completes the proof.
