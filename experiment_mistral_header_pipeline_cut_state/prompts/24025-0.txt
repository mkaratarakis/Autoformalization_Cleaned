1. **Informal Theorem**  
Nonzero LCM of Nonzero Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \neq 0 \) and \( n \neq 0 \), their least common multiple (LCM) is also nonzero, i.e., \( \text{lcm}(m, n) \neq 0 \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by assuming that \( \text{lcm}(m, n) = 0 \) and show that this leads to a contradiction.

1. Let \( h \) be the assumption that \( \text{lcm}(m, n) = 0 \). We need to show that this leads to a contradiction, i.e., \( \text{False} \).

2. We know from the property of the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm) that \( \gcd(m, n) \cdot \text{lcm}(m, n) \) is associated with \( m \cdot n \). Let \( h1 \) be this property, i.e., \( \gcd(m, n) \cdot \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \cdot n \).

3. Since \( \text{lcm}(m, n) = 0 \) by assumption \( h \), we can substitute \( 0 \) for \( \text{lcm}(m, n) \) in \( h1 \). Using the property that any natural number multiplied by \( 0 \) is \( 0 \), we get \( 0 = m \cdot n \).

4. We now consider the equation \( 0 = m \cdot n \). If \( m \neq 0 \) (which is given by \( hm \)), then \( n \) must be \( 0 \) for the product to be \( 0 \). This contradicts the assumption \( n \neq 0 \) (given by \( hn \)).

5. Similarly, if \( n \neq 0 \) (which is given by \( hn \)), then \( m \) must be \( 0 \) for the product to be \( 0 \). This contradicts the assumption \( m \neq 0 \) (given by \( hm \)).

Since both cases lead to a contradiction, our assumption that \( \text{lcm}(m, n) = 0 \) must be false. Therefore, \( \text{lcm}(m, n) \neq 0 \). This completes the proof.
