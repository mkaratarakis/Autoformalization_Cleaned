⊢ decide (true = false) = false

case true
inst✝ : Decidable (true = true)
⊢ decide (true = true) = true
case false
inst✝ : Decidable (true = false)
⊢ decide (true = false) = false

4. **New Prefix**  
   The initial Lean 4 code that you must build on.
import Init.BinderPredicates
import Init.Data.Bool

open Bool


example {b : Bool} [Decidable (true = b)]  : decide (true  = b) =  b := by
  cases b
