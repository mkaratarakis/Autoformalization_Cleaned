1. **Informal Theorem**  
Boolean Value is Not Equal to Its Negation: \( x == \neg x = \text{false} \) : For any boolean value \( x \), the boolean equality between \( x \) and its negation \(\neg x\) is `false`, i.e., \( x == \neg x = \text{false} \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that for any boolean value \( x \), the equality \( x == \neg x \) is `false`, we consider the two possible values of \( x \):

1. **Case 1: \( x = \text{true} \)**
- The negation of \( x \) is \(\neg x = \text{false}\).
- Therefore, \( x == \neg x \) is \(\text{true} == \text{false}\), which is `false`.

2. **Case 2: \( x = \text{false} \)**
- The negation of \( x \) is \(\neg x = \text{true}\).
- Therefore, \( x == \neg x \) is \(\text{false} == \text{true}\), which is `false`.

Since both cases show that \( x == \neg x \) is `false`, we conclude that for any boolean value \( x \), the equality \( x == \neg x \) is `false`. This completes the proof.
