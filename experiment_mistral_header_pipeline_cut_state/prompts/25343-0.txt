1. **Informal Theorem**  
Boolean Values are Less Than or Equal to True : For any boolean value \( x \), it holds that \( x \leq \text{true} \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that for any boolean value \( x \), \( x \leq \text{true} \), we use the fact that the boolean lattice has `true` as its maximum element. In the boolean lattice, the value `true` is greater than or equal to both `true` and `false`. Therefore, for any boolean value \( x \), \( x \) is either `true` or `false`, and in both cases, \( x \leq \text{true} \) holds. This completes the proof.
