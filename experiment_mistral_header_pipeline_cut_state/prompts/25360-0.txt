1. **Informal Theorem**  
Boolean Equality Matches Decidable Equality: \(a == b = \text{decide}(a = b)\) : For any type \(\alpha\) with a `BEq` instance, a `LawfulBEq` instance, and a `DecidableEq` instance, and for any elements \(a, b \in \alpha\), the boolean equality \(a == b\) is equal to the boolean value obtained by deciding the proposition \(a = b\), i.e., \(a == b = \text{decide}(a = b)\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We will consider every possible case of the boolean equality \(a == b\).

1. **Case 1: \(a == b = \text{false}\)**
- Using the fact that \(a == b = \text{false}\) implies \(a \neq b\) (by the `ne_of_beq_false` theorem), we can simplify the proposition to \(\text{false} = \text{decide}(a \neq b)\).
- By the definition of the `decide` function, \(\text{decide}(a \neq b) = \text{false}\) when \(a \neq b\).
- Therefore, \(\text{false} = \text{decide}(a \neq b)\) is true.

2. **Case 2: \(a == b = \text{true}\)**
- Using the fact that \(a == b = \text{true}\) implies \(a = b\) (by the `eq_of_beq` theorem), we can simplify the proposition to \(\text{true} = \text{decide}(a = b)\).
- By the definition of the `decide` function, \(\text{decide}(a = b) = \text{true}\) when \(a = b\).
- Therefore, \(\text{true} = \text{decide}(a = b)\) is true.

Since both cases are true, we conclude that \(a == b = \text{decide}(a = b)\) for any elements \(a, b \in \alpha\). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
