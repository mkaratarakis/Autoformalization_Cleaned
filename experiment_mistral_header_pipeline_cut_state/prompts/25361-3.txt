Below are the error message and proof state for the proof you generated. Please revise the proof accordingly starting with new prefix. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
6. **Error Message and Proof State**
tmp.lean:12:4: error: no goals to be solved
tmp.lean:22:24: error: unknown identifier 'b'
tmp.lean:22:18: error: tactic 'cases' failed, major premise type is not an inductive type
  ?m.527

Explanation: the 'cases' tactic is for constructor-based reasoning as well as for applying custom cases principles with a 'using' clause or a registered '@[cases_eliminator]' theorem. The above type neither is an inductive type nor has a registered theorem.
case mpr.refl.false
x✝ : ?m.527
⊢ false = true ↔ false = true
tmp.lean:22:24: error: unknown identifier 'b'
tmp.lean:22:18: error: tactic 'cases' failed, major premise type is not an inductive type
  ?m.535

Explanation: the 'cases' tactic is for constructor-based reasoning as well as for applying custom cases principles with a 'using' clause or a registered '@[cases_eliminator]' theorem. The above type neither is an inductive type nor has a registered theorem.
case mpr.refl.true
x✝ : ?m.535
⊢ true = true ↔ true = true
tmp.lean:27:4: error: no goals to be solved
tmp.lean:7:44: error: unsolved goals
case mpr
a b : Bool
⊢ a = b → (a = true ↔ b = true)

4. **New Prefix**  
   The initial Lean 4 code that you must build on.
import Init.BinderPredicates
import Init.Data.Bool

open Bool


example : ∀(a b : Bool), (a ↔ b) ↔ a = b := by
  intro a b
  apply Iff.intro
  . intro h
    cases a <;> cases b <;> simp [*] at *
