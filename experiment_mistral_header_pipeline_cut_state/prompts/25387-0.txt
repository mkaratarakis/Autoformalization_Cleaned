1. **Informal Theorem**  
Boolean to Natural Number Representation is Less Than or Equal to One : For any boolean value \( c \), the natural number representation of \( c \) (i.e., \( \text{Bool.toNat}(c) \)) is less than or equal to 1. Specifically, \(\text{Bool.toNat}(\text{false}) = 0\) and \(\text{Bool.toNat}(\text{true}) = 1\), so both values satisfy \( \text{Bool.toNat}(c) \leq 1 \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We will consider every possible case of the boolean value \( c \). Specifically, we have two cases: \( c = \text{false} \) and \( c = \text{true} \).

1. **Case 1: \( c = \text{false} \)**
- We need to show that \( \text{Bool.toNat}(\text{false}) \leq 1 \).
- By definition, \( \text{Bool.toNat}(\text{false}) = 0 \).
- Since \( 0 \leq 1 \) is true, this case is straightforward.

2. **Case 2: \( c = \text{true} \)**
- We need to show that \( \text{Bool.toNat}(\text{true}) \leq 1 \).
- By definition, \( \text{Bool.toNat}(\text{true}) = 1 \).
- Since \( 1 \leq 1 \) is true, this case is also straightforward.

Since both cases are true, we conclude that for any boolean value \( c \), \( \text{Bool.toNat}(c) \leq 1 \). This completes the proof.
