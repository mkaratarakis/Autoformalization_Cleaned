1. **Informal Theorem**  
Boolean True Equals Decide if and only if Proposition is True: \(\text{true} = \text{decide}(p) \leftrightarrow p\) : For any decidable proposition \( p \), the boolean value `true` is equal to `decide p` if and only if \( p \) is true, i.e., \( \text{true} = \text{decide}(p) \leftrightarrow p \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We need to show that \(\text{true} = \text{decide}(p) \leftrightarrow p\) for any decidable proposition \( p \). We will consider the two possible cases for \( p \).

**Case 1: \( p \) is true.**
- Assume \( p \) is true.
- By the definition of \(\text{decide}\), \(\text{decide}(p) = \text{true}\).
- Therefore, \(\text{true} = \text{decide}(p)\) is true.
- Hence, \(\text{true} = \text{decide}(p) \leftrightarrow p\) is true because both sides are true.

**Case 2: \( p \) is false.**
- Assume \( p \) is false.
- By the definition of \(\text{decide}\), \(\text{decide}(p) = \text{false}\).
- Therefore, \(\text{true} = \text{decide}(p)\) is false.
- Hence, \(\text{true} = \text{decide}(p) \leftrightarrow p\) is false because the left side is true and the right side is false, which is consistent with \( p \) being false.

In both cases, the equivalence \(\text{true} = \text{decide}(p) \leftrightarrow p\) holds. Therefore, the theorem is proved. \(\blacksquare\)
