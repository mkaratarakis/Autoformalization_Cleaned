1. **Informal Theorem**  
Boolean Conjunction of Decidable Propositions: \(\text{decide}(p \land q) = \text{decide}(p) \land \text{decide}(q)\) : For any decidable propositions \( p \) and \( q \), the boolean value of the conjunction \( p \land q \) is equal to the boolean "and" operation of the boolean values of \( p \) and \( q \), i.e., \(\text{decide}(p \land q) = \text{decide}(p) \land \text{decide}(q)\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We need to show that for any decidable propositions \( p \) and \( q \), the boolean value of \( p \land q \) is equal to the boolean "and" of the boolean values of \( p \) and \( q \).

We will consider the two possible cases for the decidable proposition \( p \):

1. **Case 1: \( p \) is true.**
- Since \( p \) is true, the boolean value of \( p \) is `true`.
- The boolean value of \( p \land q \) is the same as the boolean value of \( q \).
- Therefore, the goal is to show that the boolean value of \( q \) is equal to the boolean "and" of `true` and the boolean value of \( q \).
- This is trivially true because \(\text{true} \land q = q\).

2. **Case 2: \( p \) is false.**
- Since \( p \) is false, the boolean value of \( p \) is `false`.
- The boolean value of \( p \land q \) is `false` regardless of the boolean value of \( q \).
- Therefore, the goal is to show that `false` is equal to the boolean "and" of `false` and the boolean value of \( q \).
- This is trivially true because \(\text{false} \land q = \text{false}\).

In both cases, the goal is satisfied, thus proving the theorem. Therefore, \(\text{decide}(p \land q) = \text{decide}(p) \land \text{decide}(q)\). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
