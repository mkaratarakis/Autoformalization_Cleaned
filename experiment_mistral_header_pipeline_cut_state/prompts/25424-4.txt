Below are the error message and proof state for the proof you generated. Please revise the proof accordingly starting with new prefix. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
6. **Error Message and Proof State**
tmp.lean:12:54: error: invalid field notation, type is not of the form (C ...) where C is a constant
  hp
has type
  p
tmp.lean:16:30: error: invalid `▸` notation, argument
  h
has type
  ?m.168
equality expected
tmp.lean:16:49: error: invalid `▸` notation, argument
  h
has type
  ?m.169
equality expected
tmp.lean:16:4: error: type mismatch
  { mp := fun h => ?m.174, mpr := fun h => ?m.180 }
has type
  ?m.168 ↔ ?m.169 : Prop
but is expected to have type
  ¬p : Prop
tmp.lean:9:14: error: unsolved goals
case isTrue
p : Prop
hp : p
⊢ p
tmp.lean:9:2: error: alternative 'isFalse' has not been provided
case isTrue
p : Prop
hp : p
⊢ p

4. **New Prefix**  
   The initial Lean 4 code that you must build on.
import Init.BinderPredicates
import Init.Data.Bool




example {p : Prop} [h : Decidable p] : false = decide p ↔ ¬p := by
  cases h with
  | isTrue hp =>
    -- Case 1: p is true
    simp [decide]
