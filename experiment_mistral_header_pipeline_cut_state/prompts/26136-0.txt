1. **Informal Theorem**  
Minimum is Less Than or Equal to Right Argument in Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\), the minimum of \(a\) and \(b\) is less than or equal to \(b\), i.e., \(\min(a, b) \leq b\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that \(\min(a, b) \leq b\) for any natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\), we consider two cases based on the relationship between \(a\) and \(b\):

1. **Case 1: \(a \leq b\)**

By the definition of the minimum function, \(\min(a, b) = a\) if \(a \leq b\). Since we are assuming \(a \leq b\), it follows that \(\min(a, b) = a \leq b\). Therefore, \(\min(a, b) \leq b\) holds in this case.

2. **Case 2: \(a \not\leq b\)**

By the definition of the minimum function, \(\min(a, b) = b\) if \(a \not\leq b\). Since we are assuming \(a \not\leq b\), it follows that \(\min(a, b) = b\). Clearly, \(b \leq b\) is always true. Therefore, \(\min(a, b) \leq b\) holds in this case as well.

Since both cases cover all possible relationships between \(a\) and \(b\), we conclude that \(\min(a, b) \leq b\) for any natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
