1. **Informal Theorem**  
First Element of ZipWithAll Equals Function Applied to Optional Heads of Lists : For any types \( \alpha \), \( \beta \), and \( \gamma \), and any lists \( as : \text{List} \, \alpha \) and \( bs : \text{List} \, \beta \), and any function \( f : \text{Option} \, \alpha \to \text{Option} \, \beta \to \gamma \), if the list \( \text{zipWithAll} \, f \, as \, bs \) is non-empty, then the first element of \( \text{zipWithAll} \, f \, as \, bs \) is equal to \( f \, (\text{head?} \, as) \, (\text{head?} \, bs) \). In other words, if \( \text{zipWithAll} \, f \, as \, bs \neq [] \), then:
\[
(\text{zipWithAll} \, f \, as \, bs). \text{head} \, h = f \, (\text{head?} \, as) \, (\text{head?} \, bs)
\]
where \( h \) is a proof that \( \text{zipWithAll} \, f \, as \, bs \) is non-empty.

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the theorem, we start by using the injectivity of the `some` constructor in the `Option` type. This means that to show:
\[
(\text{zipWithAll} \, f \, as \, bs). \text{head} \, h = f \, (\text{head?} \, as) \, (\text{head?} \, bs)
\]
it suffices to show:
\[
\text{some}((\text{zipWithAll} \, f \, as \, bs). \text{head} \, h) = \text{some}(f \, (\text{head?} \, as) \, (\text{head?} \, bs))
\]

Next, we use the equivalence that the optional head of a non-empty list is `some` of the first element, and the definition of the first element of `zipWithAll`. This allows us to rewrite the goal to:
\[
\text{match } \text{head?} \, as, \text{head?} \, bs \text{ with} \\
\text{| none, none => none} \\
\text{| some } a, \text{ some } b => \text{ some } (f (\text{some } a) (\text{some } b))
\]
is equal to:
\[
\text{some} (f \, (\text{head?} \, as) \, (\text{head?} \, bs))
\]

We then discuss by cases based on the values of `head? as` and `head? bs`:
1. **Case 1:** If both `head? as` and `head? bs` are `none`, then the goal is:
\[
\text{none} = \text{some} (f \, \text{none} \, \text{none})
\]
This is a contradiction because `none` cannot be equal to `some` of any value. Therefore, this case is impossible.
2. **Case 2:** If both `head? as` and `head? bs` are `some a` and `some b` respectively, then the goal is:
\[
\text{some} (f \, (\text{some } a) \, (\text{some } b)) = \text{some} (f \, (\text{some } a) \, (\text{some } b))
\]
This is trivially true by the reflexivity of equality.

Since both cases are either impossible or trivially true, the theorem is proven. \(\blacksquare\)
