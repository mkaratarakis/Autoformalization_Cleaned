1. **Informal Theorem**  
ZipWith of Replicated Elements : For any types `α`, `β`, and `α₁`, a function `f : α → β → α₁`, elements `a : α` and `b : β`, and a natural number `n`, the result of zipping two lists created by replicating `a` and `b` `n` times with the function `f` is equivalent to replicating the result of applying `f` to `a` and `b` `n` times. Specifically, `zipWith f (replicate n a) (replicate n b) = replicate n (f a b)`.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We prove this by induction on \( n \).

**Base Case:**
For \( n = 0 \), we need to show:
\[ \text{zipWith } f \, (\text{replicate } 0 \, a) \, (\text{replicate } 0 \, b) = \text{replicate } 0 \, (f \, a \, b) \]
Since both sides of the equation are empty lists, the equality holds trivially by the reflexive property of equality.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume the inductive hypothesis that for some natural number \( k \):
\[ \text{zipWith } f \, (\text{replicate } k \, a) \, (\text{replicate } k \, b) = \text{replicate } k \, (f \, a \, b) \]
We need to show that:
\[ \text{zipWith } f \, (\text{replicate } (k + 1) \, a) \, (\text{replicate } (k + 1) \, b) = \text{replicate } (k + 1) \, (f \, a \, b) \]
Using the definition of `replicate`, we have:
\[ \text{replicate } (k + 1) \, a = a :: \text{replicate } k \, a \]
\[ \text{replicate } (k + 1) \, b = b :: \text{replicate } k \, b \]
Applying the definition of `zipWith`, we get:
\[ \text{zipWith } f \, (a :: \text{replicate } k \, a) \, (b :: \text{replicate } k \, b) = f \, a \, b :: \text{zipWith } f \, (\text{replicate } k \, a) \, (\text{replicate } k \, b) \]
By the inductive hypothesis, we know:
\[ \text{zipWith } f \, (\text{replicate } k \, a) \, (\text{replicate } k \, b) = \text{replicate } k \, (f \, a \, b) \]
Thus, we have:
\[ f \, a \, b :: \text{replicate } k \, (f \, a \, b) = \text{replicate } (k + 1) \, (f \, a \, b) \]
This completes the inductive step.

By induction, the theorem holds for all natural numbers \( n \). Therefore, the result is:
\[ \text{zipWith } f \, (\text{replicate } n \, a) \, (\text{replicate } n \, b) = \text{replicate } n \, (f \, a \, b) \]
This completes the proof.
