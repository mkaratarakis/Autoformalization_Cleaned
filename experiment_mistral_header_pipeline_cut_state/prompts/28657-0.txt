1. **Informal Theorem**  
Size of Boolean Element is One: \(\text{sizeOf}(b) = 1\) : For any boolean value \( b \), the size of \( b \) is equal to 1, i.e., \(\text{sizeOf}(b) = 1\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that \(\text{sizeOf}(b) = 1\) for any boolean value \( b \), we consider the two possible cases for \( b \):

1. **Case 1: \( b = \text{false} \)**
- By definition, \(\text{sizeOf}(\text{false}) = 1\). Therefore, the equality \(\text{sizeOf}(\text{false}) = 1\) holds.

2. **Case 2: \( b = \text{true} \)**
- By definition, \(\text{sizeOf}(\text{true}) = 1\). Therefore, the equality \(\text{sizeOf}(\text{true}) = 1\) holds.

Since both cases are covered and the equality holds in each case, we conclude that for any boolean value \( b \), \(\text{sizeOf}(b) = 1\). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
