1. **Informal Theorem**  
Boolean Negation of Equality Coincides with Logical Inequality in Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\), the boolean negation of the equality \(a == b\) is true if and only if the logical negation of the equality \(a = b\) holds. In other words, \((!a == b) = \text{true}\) if and only if \(a \neq b\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We need to show that for any natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\), the boolean negation of the equality \(a == b\) being true is equivalent to the logical negation of the equality \(a = b\).

Using the properties of equality and logical negation, we can simplify the proposition \((!a == b) = \text{true} = \neg a = b\). The boolean negation of the equality \(a == b\) being true is equivalent to the logical negation of the equality \(a = b\). This is a direct consequence of the definition of logical negation and the properties of equality.

Thus, \((!a == b) = \text{true}\) if and only if \(a \neq b\). This completes the proof.
