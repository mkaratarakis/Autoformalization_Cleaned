1. **Informal Theorem**  
Boolean Equality Coincides with Logical Equality in Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\), the boolean equality \(a == b\) is true if and only if the logical equality \(a = b\) holds. In other words, \(a == b = \text{true}\) if and only if \(a = b\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the theorem, we need to show that the boolean equality \(a == b\) is true if and only if the logical equality \(a = b\) holds. We start with the proposition \((a == b) = \text{true} = (a = b)\).

Using the properties of boolean and logical equality, we can simplify this proposition. Specifically, we use the fact that if \(a == b\) is true, then \(a = b\) must hold, and vice versa. This follows from the definitions and properties of equality in natural numbers. Therefore, the proposition \((a == b) = \text{true} = (a = b)\) is trivially true.

Hence, we have shown that \(a == b = \text{true}\) if and only if \(a = b\). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
