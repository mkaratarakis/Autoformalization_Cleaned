1. **Informal Theorem**  
Left Addition Commutativity in Natural Numbers: \( n + (m + k) = m + (n + k) \) : For any natural numbers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), the equation \( n + (m + k) = m + (n + k) \) holds. This theorem demonstrates the commutativity of addition when the first term is fixed and the other two terms are permuted.

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that \( n + (m + k) = m + (n + k) \) for any natural numbers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Step 1: Use the associativity of addition.**
By the associativity of addition, we have:
\[
n + (m + k) = n + m + k
\]

2. **Step 2: Use the commutativity of addition.**
By the commutativity of addition, we can rewrite \( n + m + k \) as:
\[
n + m + k = m + n + k
\]

3. **Step 3: Use the associativity of addition again.**
By the associativity of addition, we can rewrite \( m + n + k \) as:
\[
m + n + k = m + (n + k)
\]

Combining these steps, we have:
\[
n + (m + k) = m + (n + k)
\]

Since the right-hand side of the equation is equal to itself, the equation \( n + (m + k) = m + (n + k) \) holds. This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
