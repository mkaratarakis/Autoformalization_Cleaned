1. **Informal Theorem**  
Right Addition Commutativity in Natural Numbers: \( n + m + k = n + k + m \) : For any natural numbers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), the equation \( n + m + k = n + k + m \) holds. This theorem demonstrates the commutativity of addition when the first term is fixed and the other two terms are permuted.

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that \( n + m + k = n + k + m \) for any natural numbers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Step 1: Use Associativity of Addition**
By the associativity of addition, we can rewrite \( n + m + k \) as \( n + (m + k) \). Therefore, the goal \( n + m + k = n + k + m \) is equivalent to \( n + (m + k) = n + k + m \).

2. **Step 2: Use Commutativity of Addition**
By the commutativity of addition, we can rewrite \( m + k \) as \( k + m \). Therefore, the goal \( n + (m + k) = n + k + m \) is equivalent to \( n + (k + m) = n + k + m \).

3. **Step 3: Use Associativity of Addition Again**
By the associativity of addition, we can rewrite \( n + (k + m) \) as \( n + k + m \). Therefore, the goal \( n + (k + m) = n + k + m \) is equivalent to \( n + k + m = n + k + m \).

4. **Step 4: Reflexive Property of Equality**
The equation \( n + k + m = n + k + m \) is trivially true by the reflexive property of equality.

Thus, we have shown that \( n + m + k = n + k + m \) for any natural numbers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
