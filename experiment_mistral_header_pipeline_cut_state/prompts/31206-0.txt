1. **Informal Theorem**  
Successor of a Natural Number is Not Zero: \( n + 1 \neq 0 \) : For any natural number \( n \), the successor of \( n \), denoted as \( n + 1 \), is not equal to zero, i.e., \( n + 1 \neq 0 \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that for any natural number \( n \), the successor of \( n \), denoted as \( n + 1 \), is not equal to zero, we start by considering the properties of natural numbers and the definition of the successor function. The successor function \( n + 1 \) is defined such that it always yields a positive number, which is greater than zero. Therefore, \( n + 1 \) cannot be zero. This is a fundamental property of natural numbers and the successor function. Hence, the statement \( n + 1 \neq 0 \) is trivially true for any natural number \( n \). This completes the proof.
