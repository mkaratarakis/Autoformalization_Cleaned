1. **Informal Theorem**  
Multiplication by Two Equals Double in Natural Numbers : For any natural number \( n \), the product of \( n \) and 2 is equal to the sum of \( n \) and \( n \), i.e., \( n \times 2 = n + n \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that \( n \times 2 = n + n \) for any natural number \( n \), we start by using the property of multiplication by the successor in natural numbers. This property states that for any natural numbers \( n \) and \( m \), \( n \times (m + 1) = n \times m + n \). Applying this property with \( m = 1 \), we have:
\[
n \times 2 = n \times (1 + 1) = n \times 1 + n
\]
Next, we use the property of the multiplicative identity, which states that for any natural number \( n \), \( n \times 1 = n \). Substituting this into our equation, we get:
\[
n \times 2 = n + n
\]
Thus, we have shown that \( n \times 2 = n + n \) for any natural number \( n \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
