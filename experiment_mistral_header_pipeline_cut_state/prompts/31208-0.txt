1. **Informal Theorem**  
Multiplication by Two Equals Double in Natural Numbers : For any natural number \( n \), the product of 2 and \( n \) is equal to the sum of \( n \) and \( n \), i.e., \( 2 \cdot n = n + n \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that \(2 \cdot n = n + n\) for any natural number \( n \), we start by using the identity for the successor of a natural number in multiplication. Specifically, we know that \((n + 1) \cdot m = n \cdot m + m\) for any natural numbers \( n \) and \( m \). Applying this identity with \(2 = 1 + 1\), we rewrite the goal \(2 \cdot n\) as \((1 + 1) \cdot n\), which simplifies to \(1 \cdot n + n\).

Next, we use the multiplicative identity property, which states that \(1 \cdot a = a\) for any natural number \(a\). Applying this property, we simplify \(1 \cdot n\) to \(n\). Therefore, the goal \(1 \cdot n + n\) becomes \(n + n\).

Thus, we have shown that \(2 \cdot n = n + n\). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
