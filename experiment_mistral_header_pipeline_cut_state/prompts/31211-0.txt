1. **Informal Theorem**  
Right Addition Preserves Less-Than-or-Equal Relation in Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \( n \) and \( m \) such that \( n \leq m \), and for any natural number \( k \), it holds that \( n + k \leq m + k \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start with the assumption that \( n \leq m \) and need to show that \( n + k \leq m + k \) for any natural number \( k \).

1. Using the commutativity of addition, we can rewrite the goal \( n + k \leq m + k \) as \( k + n \leq k + m \).
2. To prove \( k + n \leq k + m \), it suffices to show \( n \leq m \) because adding the same natural number \( k \) to both sides of an inequality preserves the inequality.
3. The current goal \( n \leq m \) has already been given as a hypothesis, so it is already proved.

Thus, we have shown that \( n + k \leq m + k \) for any natural number \( k \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
