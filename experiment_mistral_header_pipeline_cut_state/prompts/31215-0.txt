1. **Informal Theorem**  
Right Addition and Subtraction Identity in Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\), the expression \(a + b - b\) is equal to \(a\), i.e., \(a + b - b = a\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that \(a + b - b = a\) for any natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\), we start by using the commutativity of addition. The commutativity of addition states that \(a + b = b + a\). Therefore, we can rewrite the expression \(a + b - b\) as \(b + a - b\).

Next, we apply the theorem that for any natural numbers \(x\) and \(y\), \(x + y - y = x\). In our case, this theorem tells us that \(b + a - b = a\).

Thus, we have shown that \(a + b - b = a\), completing the proof.
