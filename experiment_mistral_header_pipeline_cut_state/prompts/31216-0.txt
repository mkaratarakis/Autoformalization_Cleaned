1. **Informal Theorem**  
Subtraction is Less Than or Equal to Minuend in Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \( n \) and \( m \), the subtraction \( n - m \) is less than or equal to \( n \), i.e., \( n - m \leq n \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We prove this by induction on \( m \).

1. **Base Case:**
- Consider \( m = 0 \). We need to show that \( n - 0 \leq n \).
- Since \( n - 0 = n \), this is equivalent to showing \( n \leq n \).
- This is true by the reflexivity of the less than or equal to relation.

2. **Inductive Step:**
- Assume the inductive hypothesis that for some \( m' \), \( n - m' \leq n \).
- We need to show that \( n - (m' + 1) \leq n \).
- By the definition of subtraction, \( n - (m' + 1) = \text{pred}(n - m') \).
- Using the fact that the predecessor of any natural number is less than or equal to the number itself, we have \( \text{pred}(n - m') \leq n - m' \).
- By the inductive hypothesis, \( n - m' \leq n \).
- Therefore, by the transitivity of the less than or equal to relation, we have \( \text{pred}(n - m') \leq n \).

By induction, the theorem holds for all natural numbers \( m \). Therefore, for any natural numbers \( n \) and \( m \), \( n - m \leq n \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
