1. **Informal Theorem**  
Left Addition Cancellation for Less Than or Equal in Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), if \(a + b \leq a + c\), then \(b \leq c\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start with the assumption that \(a + b \leq a + c\). To prove \(b \leq c\), we need to show that there exists a natural number \(d\) such that \(b + d = c\).

1. **Step 1:**
To prove \( b + d = c \), using the left addition cancellation property, it suffices to show that \( a + (b + d) = a + c \).

2. **Step 2:**
We introduce a natural number \( d \) and the hypothesis \( hd : a + b + d = a + c \). Our goal is to show that \( b \leq c \).

3. **Step 3:**
To prove \( b \leq c \), using the introduction rule for the less-than-or-equal relation, it suffices to show that \( b + d = c \).

4. **Step 4:**
Using the associativity of addition, we can rewrite the hypothesis \( hd : a + b + d = a + c \) as \( a + (b + d) = a + c \).

5. **Step 5:**
Using the left addition cancellation property, since \( a + (b + d) = a + c \), we conclude that \( b + d = c \).

Therefore, \( b \leq c \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
