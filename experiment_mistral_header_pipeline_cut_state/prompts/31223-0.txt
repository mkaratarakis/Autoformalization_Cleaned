1. **Informal Theorem**  
Subtraction and Addition Identity for Nonzero Natural Numbers: \( a - 1 + 1 = a \) for \( a \neq 0 \) : For any natural number \( a \) such that \( a \neq 0 \), the expression \( a - 1 + 1 \) is equal to \( a \), i.e., \( a - 1 + 1 = a \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We will prove the theorem by considering two cases based on the value of \( a \).

1. **Case 1: \( a = 0 \)**
- We have the assumption \( a \neq 0 \). Therefore, the case \( a = 0 \) leads to a direct contradiction. Hence, this case is not possible, and we can conclude the proof for this case.

2. **Case 2: \( a \) is a successor of some natural number**
- Let \( a = n + 1 \) for some natural number \( n \). We need to show that \( a - 1 + 1 = a \).
- By the definition of subtraction and addition, \( a - 1 + 1 = (n + 1) - 1 + 1 \).
- Simplifying the right-hand side, we get \( (n + 1) - 1 + 1 = n + 1 \).
- Since \( n + 1 = a \), the equality \( a - 1 + 1 = a \) holds trivially in this case.

Since both cases have been considered and the equality holds in each case, we conclude that for any natural number \( a \) such that \( a \neq 0 \), the expression \( a - 1 + 1 \) is equal to \( a \). This completes the proof.
