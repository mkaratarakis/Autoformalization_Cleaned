1. **Informal Theorem**  
Natural Number Equals Its Predecessor if and Only if It is Zero: \( n - 1 = n \leftrightarrow n = 0 \) : For any natural number \( n \), the equation \( n - 1 = n \) holds if and only if \( n = 0 \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We will consider every possible case of \( n \).

**Case 1: \( n = 0 \)**
- The goal is to show \( 0 - 1 = 0 \leftrightarrow 0 = 0 \).
- Simplifying the left-hand side, we get \( 0 - 1 = 0 \). Since \( 0 - 1 \) is defined as \( 0 \) (as \( 0 - 1 \) is not a valid natural number, it is treated as \( 0 \)), the left-hand side simplifies to \( 0 = 0 \), which is true.
- Therefore, \( 0 - 1 = 0 \leftrightarrow 0 = 0 \) is true.

**Case 2: \( n = k + 1 \) for some \( k \in \mathbb{N} \)**
- The goal is to show \( (k + 1) - 1 = k + 1 \leftrightarrow k + 1 = 0 \).
- Simplifying the left-hand side, we get \( (k + 1) - 1 = k \). Therefore, the left-hand side simplifies to \( k = k + 1 \).
- The equation \( k = k + 1 \) is false for any natural number \( k \), and the right-hand side \( k + 1 = 0 \) is also false for any natural number \( k \).
- Therefore, \( (k + 1) - 1 = k + 1 \leftrightarrow k + 1 = 0 \) is true because both sides are false.

Since both cases are true, we conclude that for any natural number \( n \), the equation \( n - 1 = n \) holds if and only if \( n = 0 \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
