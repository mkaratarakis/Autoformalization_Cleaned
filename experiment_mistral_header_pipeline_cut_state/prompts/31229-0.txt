1. **Informal Theorem**  
Subtraction of Natural Number from Zero is Zero : For any natural number \( n \), the subtraction \( 0 - n \) is equal to \( 0 \), i.e., \( 0 - n = 0 \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We prove this by induction on \( n \).

1. **Base Case:**
- Consider \( n = 0 \). The goal is to show that \( 0 - 0 = 0 \).
- This is trivially true by the reflexive property of equality, since both sides of the equation are definitionally equal.

2. **Inductive Step:**
- Assume the induction hypothesis that for some natural number \( k \), \( 0 - k = 0 \).
- We need to show that \( 0 - (\text{succ}(k)) = 0 \).
- Using the induction hypothesis and the definition of subtraction for natural numbers, we simplify the expression \( 0 - (\text{succ}(k)) \) to \( \text{pred}(0) \).
- Since the predecessor of \( 0 \) is \( 0 \), the goal is reduced to showing \( 0 = 0 \), which is trivially true.

By induction, the theorem holds for all natural numbers \( n \). Therefore, for any natural number \( n \), \( 0 - n = 0 \). This completes the proof.
