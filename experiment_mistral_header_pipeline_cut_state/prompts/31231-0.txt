1. **Informal Theorem**  
Left Addition and Subtraction Identity in Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\), the expression \(a + b - a\) is equal to \(b\), i.e., \(a + b - a = b\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We prove this by induction on \(a\).

1. **Base Case: \(a = 0\)**

We need to show that \(0 + b - 0 = b\). Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[
0 + b - 0 = b
\]
which is trivially true.

2. **Inductive Step:**

Assume that for some \(a\), the statement \(a + b - a = b\) holds. We need to show that \((a + 1) + b - (a + 1) = b\).

Using the properties of natural numbers:
- By the successor addition identity, \((a + 1) + b = (a + b) + 1\).
- By the subtraction of successors, \((a + b) + 1 - (a + 1) = a + b - a\).

Therefore, the goal simplifies to:
\[
a + b - a = b
\]
By the induction hypothesis, \(a + b - a = b\) is true. Hence, the inductive step is proved.

By induction, the statement \(a + b - a = b\) holds for all natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\). This completes the proof.
