1. **Informal Theorem**  
Subtraction Inequality with Successor in Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \(a\) and \(i\), the inequality \(a - i \leq a + 1 - i\) holds.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We will prove the inequality \( a - i \leq a + 1 - i \) for any natural numbers \( a \) and \( i \) by considering two cases based on the value of \( i \).

1. **Case 1: \( i = 0 \)**
- To prove \( a - 0 \leq a + 1 - 0 \), it suffices to show \( a - 0 < a + 1 - 0 \).
- Since \( a - 0 = a \) and \( a + 1 - 0 = a + 1 \), this reduces to showing \( a < a + 1 \).
- By the property that any natural number is less than its successor, we have \( a < a + 1 \).
- Therefore, \( a - 0 \leq a + 1 - 0 \) holds.

2. **Case 2: \( i = i' + 1 \) for some natural number \( i' \)**
- We need to show \( a - (i' + 1) \leq a + 1 - (i' + 1) \).
- Using the properties of subtraction and successors, we can rewrite the goal as \( (a - i').\text{pred} \leq a - i' \).
- By the property that the predecessor of any natural number is less than or equal to the number itself, we have \( (a - i').\text{pred} \leq a - i' \).
- Therefore, \( a - (i' + 1) \leq a + 1 - (i' + 1) \) holds.

Since both cases are covered, the inequality \( a - i \leq a + 1 - i \) holds for any natural numbers \( a \) and \( i \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
