1. **Informal Theorem**  
Subtraction of Successor Preserves Strict Inequality in Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \( a \) and \( i \) such that \( i < a \), it holds that \( a - (i + 1) < a - i \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start with the goal of proving \( a - (i + 1) < a - i \). Using the properties of natural numbers, we know that adding the successor of a natural number is the same as adding one to the sum, and subtracting the successor of a natural number is the same as taking the predecessor of the result of the subtraction. Therefore, the goal \( a - (i + 1) < a - i \) can be rewritten as \( (a - i).pred < a - i \).

Next, we use the theorem that the predecessor of a natural number is strictly less than the number itself if the number is not zero. Thus, to prove \( (a - i).pred < a - i \), it suffices to show that \( a - i \neq 0 \).

To show \( a - i \neq 0 \), we use the theorem that if a natural number \( b \) is less than another natural number \( a \), then \( a \) is not zero. Therefore, it suffices to show that \( i < a \).

Finally, we use the theorem that if \( i < a \), then \( 0 < a - i \). Since \( i < a \) is given as a hypothesis, it is already proved. Therefore, \( 0 < a - i \) holds, and thus \( a - i \neq 0 \).

Since \( a - i \neq 0 \), we have \( (a - i).pred < a - i \), which completes the proof that \( a - (i + 1) < a - i \).
