1. **Informal Theorem**  
Right Addition Cancellation in Subtraction of Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \), the equation \( n + k - (m + k) = n - m \) holds.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We will prove this by induction on \( k \).

**Base Case:**
Consider \( k = 0 \). We need to show that \( n + 0 - (m + 0) = n - m \). Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
\[
n + 0 - m = n - m
\]
This is trivially true.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume the inductive hypothesis that for some natural number \( k' \), the equation \( n + k' - (m + k') = n - m \) holds. We need to show that \( n + (k' + 1) - (m + (k' + 1)) = n - m \).

Using the associativity of addition, we can rewrite the left-hand side as:
\[
n + (k' + 1) - (m + (k' + 1)) = (n + k' + 1) - (m + k' + 1)
\]
By the successor subtraction identity, this simplifies to:
\[
(n + k') - (m + k')
\]
By the inductive hypothesis, this is equal to:
\[
n - m
\]
Thus, the inductive step holds.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the equation \( n + k - (m + k) = n - m \) holds for all natural numbers \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \). This completes the proof.
