1. **Informal Theorem**  
Subtraction and Addition Inequality: \(a + b \leq c \to a \leq c - b\) : For any natural numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), if \(a + b \leq c\), then \(a \leq c - b\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by assuming that \( a + b \leq c \). This means there exists a natural number \( d \) such that \( a + b + d = c \).

To prove that \( a \leq c - b \), we use the introduction rule for the less-than-or-equal relation. It suffices to show that \( a + d = c - b \).

We construct a new lemma that states \( a + d + b = c \) by simplifying the expression \( a + b + d = c \) using the commutativity and associativity of addition in natural numbers, as well as the left-commutativity of addition.

Next, we derive another lemma that states \( c - b = a + d \) by using the property that if \( a = c + b \), then \( a - b = c \).

Since we have shown that \( c - b = a + d \), by the symmetry of equality, we can conclude that \( a + d = c - b \).

Therefore, \( a \leq c - b \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
