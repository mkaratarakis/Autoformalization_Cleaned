1. **Informal Theorem**  
Subtraction Inequality Implies Addition Inequality: \(a - b \leq c \to a \leq c + b\) : For any natural numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), if \(a - b \leq c\), then \(a \leq c + b\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We need to show that if \(a - b \leq c\), then \(a \leq c + b\). We consider two cases based on the relationship between \(a\) and \(b\).

1. **Case 1: \(a \leq b\)**

In this case, we need to show that \(a \leq c + b\). Since \(a \leq b\) and \(b \leq c + b\) (by the property that adding a non-negative number to another number preserves the inequality), we have \(a \leq c + b\) by the transitivity of the less-than-or-equal-to relation.

2. **Case 2: \(b \leq a\)**

In this case, we need to show that \(a \leq c + b\). We start by using the hypothesis \(a - b \leq c\). This implies that there exists a natural number \(d\) such that \(a - b + d = c\). We can rewrite this as \(d + a - b = c\).

Using the commutativity of addition and the associativity of addition and subtraction, we have:
\[
d + a - b = c \implies d + a = c + b
\]

Therefore, we have \(a + d = c + b\). Since \(a + d = c + b\), it follows that \(a \leq c + b\).

In both cases, we have shown that \(a \leq c + b\). Therefore, the theorem is proved. \(\blacksquare\)
