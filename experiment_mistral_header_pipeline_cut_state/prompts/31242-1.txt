Below are the error message and proof state for the proof you generated. Please revise the proof accordingly starting with new prefix. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
6. **Error Message and Proof State**
tmp.lean:8:14: error: unknown identifier 'le_total'
tmp.lean:8:2: error: tactic 'cases' failed, major premise type is not an inductive type
  ?m.103

Explanation: the 'cases' tactic is for constructor-based reasoning as well as for applying custom cases principles with a 'using' clause or a registered '@[cases_eliminator]' theorem. The above type neither is an inductive type nor has a registered theorem.
a b c : Nat
h : a - b ≤ c
x✝ : ?m.103
hlt : sorry = x✝
⊢ a ≤ c + b
tmp.lean:7:53: error: unsolved goals
a b c : Nat
h : a - b ≤ c
⊢ a ≤ c + b
a b c : Nat
h : a - b ≤ c
⊢ a ≤ c + b
