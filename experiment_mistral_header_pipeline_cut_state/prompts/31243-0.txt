1. **Informal Theorem**  
Associativity of Addition and Subtraction in Natural Numbers: \( n + m - k = n + (m - k) \) : For any natural numbers \( m \) and \( k \) such that \( k \leq m \), and for any natural number \( n \), the expression \( n + m - k \) is equal to \( n + (m - k) \), i.e., \( n + m - k = n + (m - k) \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by considering the case where \( k \leq m \). By the definition of the natural number inequality, there exists a natural number \( l \) such that \( k + l = m \).

To prove \( n + m - k = n + (m - k) \), we will simplify the left-hand side step by step:
1. Substitute \( m \) with \( k + l \) in the left-hand side:
\[
n + m - k = n + (k + l) - k
\]
2. By the property of left addition and subtraction cancellation in additive commutative groups, \( k + l - k = l \):
\[
n + (k + l) - k = n + l
\]
3. Using the commutativity of addition, \( k + l = l + k \):
\[
n + (l + k) - k = n + l
\]
4. By the associativity of addition, \( n + (l + k) = (n + l) + k \):
\[
(n + l) + k - k = n + l
\]
5. Finally, using the property of addition and subtraction cancellation, \( (n + l) + k - k = n + l \):
\[
n + l = n + l
\]
This is trivially true. Therefore, we have shown that \( n + m - k = n + (m - k) \).

Hence, the theorem is proved. \(\blacksquare\)
