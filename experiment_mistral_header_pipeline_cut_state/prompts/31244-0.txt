1. **Informal Theorem**  
Zero is Less Than the Difference of Two Natural Numbers if the First is Less Than the Second : For any natural numbers \( i \) and \( a \) such that \( i < a \), it holds that \( 0 < a - i \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We will prove this by induction on \( a \).

1. **Base Case: \( a = 0 \)**
- Consider the case where \( i = 0 \). We need to show that \( 0 < 0 - i \). However, this is a direct contradiction because \( i < 0 \) is impossible for natural numbers. Therefore, this case is vacuously true.

2. **Inductive Step:**
- Assume the statement holds for some \( a \), i.e., for any \( i < a \), \( 0 < a - i \). We need to show that for \( a + 1 \), if \( i < a + 1 \), then \( 0 < a + 1 - i \).

- **Case 1: \( i = a + 1 \)**
- This case is impossible because \( i < a + 1 \) and \( i = a + 1 \) cannot both be true.

- **Case 2: \( i < a + 1 \) and \( i \neq a + 1 \)**
- By the property of natural numbers, \( i < a + 1 \) implies \( i < a \) (since \( i \neq a + 1 \)).
- By the induction hypothesis, \( 0 < a - i \).
- We also know that \( a - i \leq a + 1 - i \) (by the property of subtraction with successor in natural numbers).
- By the transitivity of less-than and less-than-or-equal, \( 0 < a + 1 - i \).

Therefore, by induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers \( a \) and \( i \) such that \( i < a \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
