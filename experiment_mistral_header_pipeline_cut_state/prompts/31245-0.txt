1. **Informal Theorem**  
Left Subtraction Preserves Strict Inequality in Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \), if \( n \leq k \) and \( k < n + m \), then \( k - n < m \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by noting the given conditions: \( n \leq k \) and \( k < n + m \). We need to show that \( k - n < m \).

1. **Construct a Lemma:**
First, we construct a lemma that states \( k + 1 - n \leq (n + m) - n \). This follows from the fact that if \( k < n + m \), then \( k + 1 \leq n + m \) (by the property that the successor of a number less than another number is less than or equal to that number), and by the property that subtraction preserves the less-than-or-equal-to relation in additive groups.

2. **Simplify the Lemma:**
Next, we simplify the lemma \( k + 1 - n \leq (n + m) - n \) using the properties of addition and subtraction. Specifically, we use the fact that \( a + b - a = b \) (left addition and subtraction cancel each other) to simplify \( (n + m) - n \) to \( m \). Additionally, we use the property that \( (k + 1) - n = (k - n) + 1 \) (successor subtraction identity) to rewrite \( k + 1 - n \) as \( (k - n) + 1 \). This simplifies our lemma to \( (k - n) + 1 \leq m \).

3. **Conclude the Proof:**
Since \( (k - n) + 1 \leq m \) is equivalent to \( k - n < m \), we have shown the desired inequality. Therefore, \( k - n < m \).

This completes the proof.
