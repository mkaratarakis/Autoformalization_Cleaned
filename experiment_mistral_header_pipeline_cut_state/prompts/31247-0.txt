1. **Informal Theorem**  
Distributive Property of Multiplication over Subtraction in Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), the product of \( n \) with the difference \( m - k \) is equal to the difference between the product of \( n \) and \( m \) and the product of \( n \) and \( k \). In other words, \( n \times (m - k) = n \times m - n \times k \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the distributive property of multiplication over subtraction in natural numbers, we start with the goal \( n \times (m - k) = n \times m - n \times k \).

1. **Step 1: Use Commutativity of Multiplication**
- By the commutativity of multiplication, we can rewrite \( n \times (m - k) \) as \( (m - k) \times n \). Thus, our goal becomes:
\[
(m - k) \times n = n \times m - n \times k
\]

2. **Step 2: Apply Right Distributive Property**
- Using the right distributive property of multiplication over subtraction, we have:
\[
(m - k) \times n = m \times n - k \times n
\]
- Therefore, our goal now is:
\[
m \times n - k \times n = n \times m - n \times k
\]

3. **Step 3: Use Commutativity of Multiplication Again**
- By the commutativity of multiplication, we can rewrite \( m \times n \) as \( n \times m \) and \( k \times n \) as \( n \times k \). Thus, our goal becomes:
\[
n \times m - n \times k = n \times m - n \times k
\]

4. **Step 4: Trivial Equality**
- The equation \( n \times m - n \times k = n \times m - n \times k \) is trivially true by the properties of equality.

Thus, we have shown that \( n \times (m - k) = n \times m - n \times k \), completing the proof.
