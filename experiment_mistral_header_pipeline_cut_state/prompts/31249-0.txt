1. **Informal Theorem**  
Addition and Subtraction Inequality: \(b \leq c \to a \leq c - b \to a + b \leq c\) : For any natural numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), if \(b \leq c\) and \(a \leq c - b\), then \(a + b \leq c\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start with the given conditions \(b \leq c\) and \(a \leq c - b\). To prove \(a + b \leq c\), we will show that \(a + b + d = c\) for some \(d\) such that \(a + d = c - b\).

1. **Simplify the expression:**
Using the commutativity and associativity properties of addition in natural numbers, we simplify the expression \(a + b + d\) to \(a + d + b\).

2. **Introduce a new variable:**
We introduce a new variable \(d\) and the hypothesis \(a + d = c - b\). This allows us to reason about the expression involving \(d\).

3. **Apply the introduction rule:**
To prove \(a + b \leq c\), it suffices to show that \(a + b + d = c\), using the introduction rule for the less-than-or-equal relation in natural numbers.

4. **Rewrite the goal:**
Since \(b \leq c\) and \(a + d = c - b\), we can use the property that if \(a - c = b\), then \(a = b + c\). By symmetry, \(c - b = a + d\) implies \(c = a + d + b\). Therefore, the goal \(a + b + d = c\) is equivalent to \(a + b + d = a + d + b\).

5. **Simplify the final expression:**
Using the commutativity and associativity properties of addition in natural numbers, we simplify the expression \(a + b + d\) to \(a + d + b\), which is trivially true.

Thus, we have shown that \(a + b \leq c\). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
