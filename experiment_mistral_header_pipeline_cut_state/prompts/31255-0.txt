1. **Informal Theorem**  
Addition and Subtraction Inequality: \(a < c - b \to a + b < c\) : For any natural numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), if \(a < c - b\), then \(a + b < c\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by showing that \( b \leq c \). To do this, we use the theorem that if \( c \) is not less than \( b \), then \( b \leq c \). Therefore, it suffices to show that \( c \) is not less than \( b \).

Let \( hgt \) be an arbitrary hypothesis that \( c < b \). We need to show that this leads to a contradiction. To derive a contradiction, we use the theorem that no natural number is less than zero. Therefore, it suffices to show that \( a < 0 \).

Since \( c < b \) implies \( c \leq b \), we can use the theorem that \( c - b = 0 \). Substituting this into the hypothesis \( a < c - b \), we get \( a < 0 \). This is a contradiction because no natural number is less than zero. Therefore, \( c \) is not less than \( b \), and thus \( b \leq c \).

Next, we construct a new lemma that \( a + 1 + b \leq c \). This follows from the theorem that if \( b \leq c \) and \( a \leq c - b \), then \( a + b \leq c \). We use the hypothesis \( b \leq c \) and the fact that \( a < c - b \) implies \( a \leq c - b \).

Using the theorem that \( a + 1 + b = (a + b) + 1 \), we simplify the lemma to \( a + b + 1 \leq c \). This implies \( a + b < c \).

Therefore, we have shown that if \( a < c - b \), then \( a + b < c \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
