1. **Informal Theorem**  
Multiplication of Predecessor with Natural Number: \((n - 1) \cdot m = n \cdot m - m\) : For any natural numbers \( n \) and \( m \), the product of the predecessor of \( n \) and \( m \) is equal to the product of \( n \) and \( m \) minus \( m \). In other words, \((n - 1) \cdot m = n \cdot m - m\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We will prove this by induction on \( n \).

**Base Case:**
Consider \( n = 0 \). We need to show that \(\text{pred}(0) \cdot m = 0 \cdot m - m\). Since \(\text{pred}(0) = 0\), the left-hand side is \(0 \cdot m\). The right-hand side is \(0 \cdot m - m\). Using the properties of natural numbers, we can simplify \(0 \cdot m - m\) to \(-m\), which is \(0 - m = -m\). Since \(0 \cdot m = 0\), the equation simplifies to \(0 = 0 - m\), which is trivially true. Therefore, the base case holds.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume the statement holds for some natural number \( k \), i.e., \(\text{pred}(k) \cdot m = k \cdot m - m\). We need to show that \(\text{pred}(k + 1) \cdot m = (k + 1) \cdot m - m\). By the definition of the predecessor, \(\text{pred}(k + 1) = k\). Therefore, the left-hand side is \(k \cdot m\). The right-hand side is \((k + 1) \cdot m - m\). Using the identity for the successor of a natural number, \((k + 1) \cdot m = k \cdot m + m\). Substituting this into the right-hand side, we get \(k \cdot m + m - m\). By the property of addition and subtraction in natural numbers, \(k \cdot m + m - m = k \cdot m\). Thus, the left-hand side and the right-hand side are equal, and the inductive step holds.

By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement \((n - 1) \cdot m = n \cdot m - m\) holds for all natural numbers \( n \) and \( m \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
