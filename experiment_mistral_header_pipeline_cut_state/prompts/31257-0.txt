1. **Informal Theorem**  
Subtraction and Addition Inequality: \(a \leq c + b \to a - b \leq c\) : For any natural numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), if \(a \leq c + b\), then \(a - b \leq c\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We need to show that for any natural numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), if \(a \leq c + b\), then \(a - b \leq c\).

1. **Case 1: \(a \leq b\)**

- Since \(a \leq b\), by the property of natural numbers, \(a - b = 0\).
- Therefore, our goal \(a - b \leq c\) is equivalent to \(0 \leq c\).
- We use the fact that \(0\) is less than or equal to any natural number \(c\). This completes the proof for the case \(a \leq b\).

2. **Case 2: \(b \leq a\)**

- There exists a natural number \(d\) such that \(a + d = c + b\).
- To prove \(a - b \leq c\), it suffices to show that \(a - b + d = c\).
- We construct a new hypothesis \(a + d - b = c\) from the given hypothesis \(a + d = c + b\) using the property that if \(a = c + b\), then \(a - b = c\).
- We simplify the goal \(a - b + d = c\) using the commutativity of addition and the associativity of addition and subtraction. Specifically, we use the commutativity of addition to rewrite \(a - b + d\) as \(d + (a - b)\), then use the associativity of addition and subtraction to rewrite \(d + (a - b)\) as \(d + a - b\), and finally use the commutativity of addition again to rewrite \(d + a - b\) as \(a + d - b\). Thus, our goal is equivalent to \(a + d - b = c\).
- The current goal \(a + d - b = c\) is exactly proved by the hypothesis \(a + d - b = c\).

This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
