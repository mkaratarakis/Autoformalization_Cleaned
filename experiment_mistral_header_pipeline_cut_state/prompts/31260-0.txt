1. **Informal Theorem**  
Addition and Subtraction Identity in Natural Numbers: \(a + (b - a) = b\) : For any natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a \leq b\), the sum of \(a\) and the difference \(b - a\) is equal to \(b\), i.e., \(a + (b - a) = b\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by noting that the assumption that the cardinality of $n$ is zero is equivalent to, and thus can be converted to $n$ being empty. We need to prove that the determinant of $M$ is $1$. First, we try to show that $M = 1$ (the identity matrix). To show this, we prove that for every $i \in n$, $M i = 1 i$. However, since $n$ is empty, $M i = 1 i$ holds for every $i \in n$ vacuously. Hence, $M = 1$. Therefore, the determinant of $M$ is $\det M = \det 1 = 1$. This completes the proof.

#### Informal Step 1

**Formal proof line:**
rw [sub_succ, Nat.succ_add, ← Nat.add_succ, Nat.succ_pred hne, ih this]

**Informal translation:**
We use the following identities to rewrite the goal:
1. \( b - (a + 1) = (b - a).pred \) (since \( b - (a + 1) \) is the predecessor of \( b - a \)).
2. \( a + 1 + (b - a).pred = (a + (b - a).pred).succ \) (since adding 1 to a number and then adding another number is the same as adding the number and then adding 1).
3. \( (a + (b - a).pred).succ = a + (b - a).pred.succ \) (since adding a number and then adding 1 is the same as adding 1 to the sum).
4. \( (b - a).pred.succ = b - a \) (since the successor of the predecessor of a nonzero number is the number itself).
5. \( a + (b - a) = b \) (by the induction hypothesis, since \( a \leq b \)).

Thus, the goal \( a + 1 + (b - (a + 1)) = b \) is equivalent to \( b = b \), which is trivially true.

#### Informal Step 2

**Formal proof line:**
| zero => simp

**Informal translation:**
For the base case where \( a = 0 \), we simplify the goal \( 0 + (b - 0) = b \) to \( b = b \), which is trivially true.

#### Informal Step 3

**Formal proof line:**
| succ a ih =>

**Informal translation:**
For the inductive step, assume \( a = k + 1 \) and the induction hypothesis \( k \leq b \to k + (b - k) = b \). We need to show \( k + 1 + (b - (k + 1)) = b \).

#### Informal Step 4

**Formal proof line:**
have hne : b - a ≠ 0 := Nat.sub_ne_zero_of_lt h

**Informal translation:**
We construct a lemma \( hne \) stating that \( b - a \neq 0 \) because \( a < b \) implies \( b - a \neq 0 \).

#### Informal Step 5

**Formal proof line:**
have : a ≤ b := Nat.le_of_succ_le h

**Informal translation:**
We construct a lemma stating that \( a \leq b \) because \( a + 1 \leq b \) implies \( a \leq b \).

#### Informal Step 6

**Formal proof line:**
rw [sub_succ, Nat.succ_add, ← Nat.add_succ, Nat.succ_pred hne, ih this]

**Informal translation:**
We use the following identities to rewrite the goal:
1. \( b - (a + 1) = (b - a).pred \) (since \( b - (a + 1) \) is the predecessor of \( b - a \)).
2. \( a + 1 + (b - a).pred = (a + (b - a).pred).succ \) (since adding 1 to a number and then adding another number is the same as adding the number and then adding 1).
3. \( (a + (b - a).pred).succ = a + (b - a).pred.succ \) (since adding a number and then adding 1 is the same as adding 1 to the sum).
4. \( (b - a).pred.succ = b - a \) (since the successor of the predecessor of a nonzero number is the number itself).
5. \( a + (b - a) = b \) (by the induction hypothesis, since \( a \leq b \)).

Thus, the goal \( a + 1 + (b - (a + 1)) = b \) is equivalent to \( b = b \), which is trivially true.

### Whole Informal Proof

**Theorem:**
For any natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a \leq b\), the sum of \(a\) and the difference \(b - a\) is equal to \(b\), i.e., \(a + (b - a) = b\).

**Proof:**
We prove this by induction on \(a\).

**Base Case:**
For \(a = 0\), we need to show \(0 + (b - 0) = b\). Simplifying, we get \(b = b\), which is trivially true.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume the statement holds for \(a = k\), i.e., \(k + (b - k) = b\). We need to show that \(k + 1 + (b - (k + 1)) = b\).

1. First, we note that \(b - (k + 1) = (b - k).pred\) because \(b - (k + 1)\) is the predecessor of \(b - k\).
2. Then, \(k + 1 + (b - (k + 1)) = k + 1 + (b - k).pred\).
3. By the properties of addition and the successor function, \(k + 1 + (b - k).pred = (k + (b - k).pred).succ\).
4. Using the property of the successor and predecessor, \((k + (b - k).pred).succ = k + (b - k)\).
5. By the induction hypothesis, \(k + (b - k) = b\).

Thus, \(k + 1 + (b - (k + 1)) = b\), completing the inductive step.

By induction, the statement \(a + (b - a) = b\) holds for all natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a \leq b\). This completes the proof.
