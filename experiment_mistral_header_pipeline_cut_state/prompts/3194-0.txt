1. **Informal Theorem**  
Division Identity: \(a / b = (a - b) / b + 1\) for \(0 < b \le a\) : For any natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(0 < b\) and \(b \le a\), the division \(a / b\) is equal to \((a - b) / b + 1\), i.e., \(a / b = (a - b) / b + 1\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We begin by using the definition of division for natural numbers, which states that \(a / b\) is defined as the maximum \(k\) such that \(b \cdot k \leq a\). Given the conditions \(0 < b\) and \(b \leq a\), the condition for the positive branch of the if-statement in the definition of division is satisfied. Therefore, we can simplify the goal to show that \(a / b = (a - b) / b + 1\) by using the positive branch of the if-statement. This branch requires us to prove two conditions: \(0 < b\) and \(b \leq a\), which are already given as assumptions. Thus, the goal is satisfied, and we have shown that \(a / b = (a - b) / b + 1\).
