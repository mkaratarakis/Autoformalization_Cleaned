1. **Informal Theorem**  
Modulo Operation Preserves Less Than or Equal Relation in Natural Numbers : For any natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \), the remainder when \( x \) is divided by \( y \) is less than or equal to \( x \), i.e., \( x \% y \leq x \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We consider two main cases based on the relationship between \( x \) and \( y \):

1. **Case 1: \( x < y \)**
If \( x \) is less than \( y \), then by the definition of the modulo operation, \( x \% y = x \). Since \( x \) is equal to itself, it is trivially less than or equal to \( x \).

2. **Case 2: \( x ≥ y \)**
If \( x \) is greater than or equal to \( y \), we further consider two sub-cases for \( y \):

- **Sub-case 2.1: \( y = 0 \)**
If \( y \) is zero, then by the definition of the modulo operation, \( x \% 0 = x \). Since \( x \) is equal to itself, it is trivially less than or equal to \( x \).

- **Sub-case 2.2: \( y > 0 \)**
If \( y \) is positive, then by the property of the modulo operation, \( x \% y < y \). Since \( y \leq x \) (from the assumption \( x ≥ y \)), we can use the transitivity of the less than or equal relation to conclude that \( x \% y \leq x \).

Thus, in all cases, we have shown that \( x \% y \leq x \). This completes the proof.
