1. **Informal Theorem**  
Modulo of a Number by One is Zero : For any natural number \( x \), the modulo operation \( x \% 1 \) is equal to 0, i.e., \( x \% 1 = 0 \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by noting that the remainder of any natural number \( x \) when divided by a positive number \( y \) is less than \( y \). Since \( 1 > 0 \) is trivially true, we can apply this property to conclude \( x \% 1 < 1 \).

Next, we construct a lemma that for any natural number \( y \), if \( y < 1 \), then \( y \) must be \( 0 \). This lemma will be useful in proving our main goal.

Let \( y \) be an arbitrary natural number. We need to show that if \( y < 1 \), then \( y = 0 \).

Consider the case when \( y \) is \( 0 \). If \( y < 1 \), then \( y = 0 \) is trivially true by reflexivity.

Now, consider the case when \( y \) is of the form \( y + 1 \). If \( y + 1 < 1 \), then by the property that the successor of a number is less than the successor of another number implies the original numbers are in the same order, we have \( y < 0 \). However, this contradicts the fact that no natural number is less than \( 0 \). Therefore, this case is impossible, and we conclude that \( y \) must be \( 0 \).

Finally, we apply the lemma we constructed earlier to \( x \% 1 \). Since we have already shown that \( x \% 1 < 1 \), by the lemma, we conclude that \( x \% 1 = 0 \).

This completes the proof.
