6. **Error Message and Proof State**
tmp.lean:10:2: error: tactic 'cases' failed, major premise type is not an inductive type
  Prop

Explanation: the 'cases' tactic is for constructor-based reasoning as well as for applying custom cases principles with a 'using' clause or a registered '@[cases_eliminator]' theorem. The above type neither is an inductive type nor has a registered theorem.

Consider using the 'by_cases' tactic, which does true/false reasoning for propositions.
