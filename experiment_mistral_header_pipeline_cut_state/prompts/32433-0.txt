1. **Informal Theorem**  
Successor of Minimum is Minimum of Successors: \(\min(x + 1, y + 1) = \min(x, y) + 1\) : For any natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \), the minimum of their successors is equal to the successor of their minimum, i.e., \(\min(x + 1, y + 1) = \min(x, y) + 1\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We need to show that for any natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \), \(\min(x + 1, y + 1) = \min(x, y) + 1\).

Consider the following cases:

1. **Case 1: \( y \leq x \)**
- By the property of the minimum function, \(\min(x, y) = y\).
- Since the successor function preserves the less than or equal relation, we have \( y + 1 \leq x + 1 \).
- Therefore, \(\min(x + 1, y + 1) = y + 1\).
- Hence, \(\min(x + 1, y + 1) = \min(x, y) + 1\) is equivalent to \( y + 1 = y + 1 \), which is trivially true.

2. **Case 2: \( x \leq y \)**
- By the property of the minimum function, \(\min(x, y) = x\).
- Since the successor function preserves the less than or equal relation, we have \( x + 1 \leq y + 1 \).
- Therefore, \(\min(x + 1, y + 1) = x + 1\).
- Hence, \(\min(x + 1, y + 1) = \min(x, y) + 1\) is equivalent to \( x + 1 = x + 1 \), which is trivially true.

In both cases, the goal is satisfied. Therefore, for any natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \), \(\min(x + 1, y + 1) = \min(x, y) + 1\). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
