Below are the error message and proof state for the proof you generated. Please revise the proof accordingly starting with new prefix. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
6. **Error Message and Proof State**
Try these:
• simp +arith
• simp +arith +decide
tmp.lean:11:2: error: `simp_arith` has been deprecated. It was a shorthand for `simp +arith +decide`, but most of the time, `+decide` was redundant since simprocs have been implemented.
tmp.lean:10:63: error: unsolved goals
a b : Nat
⊢ (a + 1) * (b + 1) = a * b + a + b + 1
a b : Nat
⊢ (a + 1) * (b + 1) = a * b + a + b + 1

4. **New Prefix**
