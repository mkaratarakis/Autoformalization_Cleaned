1. **Informal Theorem**  
Boolean Or with False is Identity: $b \lor \text{false} = b$ : For any boolean value $b$, the boolean "or" operation between $b$ and `false` is equal to $b$, i.e., $b \lor \text{false} = b$.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We will consider every possible case of the boolean value $b$.

1. **Case 1: $b = \text{false}$**
- We need to show that $(\text{false} \lor \text{false}) = \text{false}$.
- This equality holds trivially because both sides are definitionally equal.

2. **Case 2: $b = \text{true}$**
- We need to show that $(\text{true} \lor \text{false}) = \text{true}$.
- This equality holds trivially because both sides are definitionally equal.

Since both cases are covered and the equality holds in each case, we conclude that for any boolean value $b$, the boolean "or" operation between $b$ and `false` is equal to $b$. Therefore, $b \lor \text{false} = b$. This completes the proof.
