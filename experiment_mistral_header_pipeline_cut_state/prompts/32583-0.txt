1. **Informal Theorem**  
True is the Identity for Boolean AND: $\text{true} \land b = b$ : For any boolean value $b$, the boolean AND operation between `true` and $b$ is equal to $b$, i.e., $\text{true} \land b = b$.

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the theorem, we consider every possible value of $b$.

**Case 1: $b = \text{false}$**
- We need to show that $(\text{true} \land \text{false}) = \text{false}$.
- By the definition of the boolean AND operation, $\text{true} \land \text{false} = \text{false}$.
- Therefore, the equality holds.

**Case 2: $b = \text{true}$**
- We need to show that $(\text{true} \land \text{true}) = \text{true}$.
- By the definition of the boolean AND operation, $\text{true} \land \text{true} = \text{true}$.
- Therefore, the equality holds.

Since both cases are covered and the equality holds in each case, we conclude that for any boolean value $b$, $\text{true} \land b = b$. This completes the proof. $\blacksquare$
