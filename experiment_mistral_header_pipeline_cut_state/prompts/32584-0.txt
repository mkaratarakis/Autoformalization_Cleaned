1. **Informal Theorem**  
Boolean AND is Idempotent: \( b \land b = b \) : For any boolean value \( b \), the boolean "and" operation \( b \text{ and } b \) is equal to \( b \), i.e., \( b \land b = b \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We will consider every possible case of the boolean value \( b \).

**Case 1: \( b = \text{false} \)**
- The goal is to show that \( \text{false} \land \text{false} = \text{false} \).
- This is trivially true because the boolean "and" operation of \(\text{false}\) with itself is \(\text{false}\).

**Case 2: \( b = \text{true} \)**
- The goal is to show that \( \text{true} \land \text{true} = \text{true} \).
- This is trivially true because the boolean "and" operation of \(\text{true}\) with itself is \(\text{true}\).

Since both cases are trivially true, we conclude that for any boolean value \( b \), \( b \land b = b \). This completes the proof.
