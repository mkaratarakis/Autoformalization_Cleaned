1. **Informal Theorem**  
Boolean Or with True is True: $b \lor \text{true} = \text{true}$ : For any boolean value $b$, the boolean "or" operation between $b$ and `true` is equal to `true`, i.e., $b \lor \text{true} = \text{true}$.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We will consider every possible case of the boolean value $b$.

1. **Case 1: $b = \text{false}$**
- In this case, the expression $(\text{false} \lor \text{true})$ is equal to $\text{true}$ by the definition of the boolean "or" operation. Therefore, the equality $(\text{false} \lor \text{true}) = \text{true}$ holds.

2. **Case 2: $b = \text{true}$**
- In this case, the expression $(\text{true} \lor \text{true})$ is equal to $\text{true}$ by the definition of the boolean "or" operation. Therefore, the equality $(\text{true} \lor \text{true}) = \text{true}$ holds.

Since both cases have been verified, we conclude that for any boolean value $b$, the boolean "or" operation between $b$ and $\text{true}$ is equal to $\text{true}$. This completes the proof.
