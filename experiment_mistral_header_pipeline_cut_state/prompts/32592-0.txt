1. **Informal Theorem**  
Boolean Or is Idempotent: $b \lor b = b$ : For any boolean value $b$, the boolean "or" operation of $b$ with itself is equal to $b$, i.e., $b \lor b = b$.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We will consider every possible case of the boolean value $b$.

1. **Case 1: $b = \text{false}$**
- In this case, the expression $(\text{false} \lor \text{false})$ is equal to $\text{false}$ by the definition of the boolean "or" operation. Therefore, the equality $(\text{false} \lor \text{false}) = \text{false}$ holds trivially.

2. **Case 2: $b = \text{true}$**
- In this case, the expression $(\text{true} \lor \text{true})$ is equal to $\text{true}$ by the definition of the boolean "or" operation. Therefore, the equality $(\text{true} \lor \text{true}) = \text{true}$ holds trivially.

Since both cases have been verified, we conclude that for any boolean value $b$, the boolean "or" operation of $b$ with itself is equal to $b$, i.e., $b \lor b = b$. This completes the proof.
