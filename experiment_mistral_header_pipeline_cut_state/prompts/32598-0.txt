1. **Informal Theorem**  
False AND Identity: $\text{false} \land b = \text{false}$ : For any boolean value $b$, the boolean "and" operation between `false` and $b$ is equal to `false`, i.e., $\text{false} \land b = \text{false}$.

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that $\text{false} \land b = \text{false}$ for any boolean value $b$, we will consider the two possible cases for $b$.

**Case 1: $b = \text{false}$**
We need to show that $\text{false} \land \text{false} = \text{false}$. By the definition of the boolean "and" operation, $\text{false} \land \text{false} = \text{false}$, which is trivially true.

**Case 2: $b = \text{true}$**
We need to show that $\text{false} \land \text{true} = \text{false}$. By the definition of the boolean "and" operation, $\text{false} \land \text{true} = \text{false}$, which is also trivially true.

Since both cases are true, we conclude that for any boolean value $b$, $\text{false} \land b = \text{false}$. This completes the proof. $\blacksquare$
