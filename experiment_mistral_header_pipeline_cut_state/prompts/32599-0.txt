1. **Informal Theorem**  
Boolean AND with True Equals the Original Boolean Value : For any boolean value $b$, the boolean "and" operation between $b$ and `true` is equal to $b$, i.e., $b \land \text{true} = b$.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We will consider every possible case of the boolean value $b$.

1. **Case 1: $b = \text{false}$**
- We need to show that $(\text{false} \land \text{true}) = \text{false}$.
- The left-hand side $(\text{false} \land \text{true})$ is definitionally equal to $\text{false}$.
- Therefore, the equality $(\text{false} \land \text{true}) = \text{false}$ holds.

2. **Case 2: $b = \text{true}$**
- We need to show that $(\text{true} \land \text{true}) = \text{true}$.
- The left-hand side $(\text{true} \land \text{true})$ is definitionally equal to $\text{true}$.
- Therefore, the equality $(\text{true} \land \text{true}) = \text{true}$ holds.

Since both cases are covered and the equality holds in each case, we conclude that for any boolean value $b$, the boolean "and" operation between $b$ and `true` is equal to $b$. This completes the proof.
