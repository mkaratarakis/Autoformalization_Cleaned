1. **Informal Theorem**  
Boolean Not-Equal Function Returns False for Equal Elements: $a \neq a = \text{false}$ : For any type $\alpha$ with a `BEq` instance and a `LawfulBEq` instance, and for any element $a \in \alpha$, the boolean not-equal function `a != a` returns `false`. This means that the boolean expression `a != a` is always `false` for any element $a$ in the type $\alpha$.

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that \((a \neq a) = \text{false}\) for any element \(a \in \alpha\), we use the definition of the boolean not-equal function `bne`. The function `bne` is defined as the boolean negation of the equality function, i.e., \(a \neq a\) is equivalent to \(\text{not}(a == a)\). Since \(a == a\) is always `true` (by the reflexivity of equality), \(\text{not}(a == a)\) is \(\text{not}(\text{true})\), which is `false`. Therefore, \((a \neq a) = \text{false}\). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
