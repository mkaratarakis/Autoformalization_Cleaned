1. **Informal Theorem**  
Boolean Equality Implies True if and only if Elements are Equal: \( (a == b) = \text{true} \leftrightarrow a = b \) : For any boolean values \( a \) and \( b \), the boolean equality \( a == b \) is true if and only if \( a \) is equal to \( b \), i.e., \( (a == b) = \text{true} \) if and only if \( a = b \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We need to show that for any boolean values \( a \) and \( b \), the boolean equality \( a == b \) is true if and only if \( a \) is equal to \( b \). This can be expressed as \((a == b) = \text{true} \leftrightarrow a = b\).

To prove this, we use the properties of boolean equality and the equivalence of true propositions. Specifically, we use the fact that if a proposition \( p \) is equal to `True`, then \( p \) holds. This is formalized by the theorem \( p = \text{True} \implies p \).

By applying these properties, we can simplify the proposition \((a == b) = \text{true} \leftrightarrow a = b\) to a trivially true statement. Therefore, the boolean equality \( a == b \) is true if and only if \( a \) is equal to \( b \).

This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
