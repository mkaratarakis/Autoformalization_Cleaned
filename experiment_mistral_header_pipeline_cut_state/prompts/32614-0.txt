1. **Informal Theorem**  
Negation of Boolean True is False: \(\neg \text{true} = \text{false}\) : For any boolean value \( b \), the negation of \( b \) is equal to `false` if and only if \( b \) is equal to `true`, i.e., \(\neg b = \text{false} \leftrightarrow b = \text{true}\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We will consider every possible case of the boolean value \( b \).

1. **Case 1: \( b = \text{false} \)**
- We need to show that \(\neg \text{false} = \text{false} \leftrightarrow \text{false} = \text{true}\).
- Since \(\neg \text{false} = \text{true}\) and \(\text{false} \neq \text{true}\), the left-hand side is \(\text{true} = \text{false}\), which is false, and the right-hand side is \(\text{false} = \text{true}\), which is also false.
- Therefore, both sides are equal, and the statement holds.

2. **Case 2: \( b = \text{true} \)**
- We need to show that \(\neg \text{true} = \text{false} \leftrightarrow \text{true} = \text{true}\).
- Since \(\neg \text{true} = \text{false}\) and \(\text{true} = \text{true}\), the left-hand side is \(\text{false} = \text{false}\), which is true, and the right-hand side is \(\text{true} = \text{true}\), which is also true.
- Therefore, both sides are equal, and the statement holds.

Since both cases are covered and the statement holds in each case, we conclude that for any boolean value \( b \), \(\neg b = \text{false} \leftrightarrow b = \text{true}\). This completes the proof.
