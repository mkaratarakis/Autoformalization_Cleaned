1. **Informal Theorem**  
Negation of Boolean Value Equals False if and only if Value is True: \(\text{not } b = \text{false} \iff b = \text{true}\) : For any boolean value \( b \), the negation of \( b \) is equal to `false` if and only if \( b \) is equal to `true`, i.e., \(\text{not } b = \text{false} \iff b = \text{true}\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We will consider every possible case of the boolean value \( b \). There are two cases:

1. **Case 1: \( b = \text{false} \)**
- We need to show that \((\text{not } \text{false}) = \text{false} \) is equivalent to \(\text{false} = \text{true} \).
- Simplify the expression \((\text{not } \text{false}) = \text{false} \). Since \(\text{not } \text{false} = \text{true} \), the expression becomes \(\text{true} = \text{false} \), which is false.
- Simplify the expression \(\text{false} = \text{true} \), which is also false.
- Therefore, \((\text{not } \text{false}) = \text{false} \) is equivalent to \(\text{false} = \text{true} \).

2. **Case 2: \( b = \text{true} \)**
- We need to show that \((\text{not } \text{true}) = \text{false} \) is equivalent to \(\text{true} = \text{true} \).
- Simplify the expression \((\text{not } \text{true}) = \text{false} \). Since \(\text{not } \text{true} = \text{false} \), the expression becomes \(\text{false} = \text{false} \), which is true.
- Simplify the expression \(\text{true} = \text{true} \), which is also true.
- Therefore, \((\text{not } \text{true}) = \text{false} \) is equivalent to \(\text{true} = \text{true} \).

Since both cases are true, we conclude that for any boolean value \( b \), \(\text{not } b = \text{false} \) if and only if \( b = \text{true} \). This completes the proof.
