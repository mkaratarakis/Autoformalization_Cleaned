1. **Informal Theorem**  
Prefix Preservation under List Element Removal at Same Index : For any lists \( l \) and \( l' \) of elements of type \( \alpha \), if \( l \) is a prefix of \( l' \), then for any natural number \( k \), the list obtained by removing the element at index \( k \) from \( l \) is a prefix of the list obtained by removing the element at index \( k \) from \( l' \). In other words, if \( l \) is a prefix of \( l' \), then \( l \setminus \{l[k]\} \) is a prefix of \( l' \setminus \{l'[k]\} \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
Given that \( l \) is a prefix of \( l' \), we can write \( l' \) as \( l \) concatenated with some list \( t \). Therefore, the goal is to show that removing the element at index \( k \) from \( l \) results in a list that is a prefix of the list obtained by removing the element at index \( k \) from \( l \) concatenated with \( t \).

Consider the following cases:

1. **Case 1: \( k \) is less than the length of \( l \):**
- In this case, removing the element at index \( k \) from \( l \) results in a list that is a prefix of the list obtained by removing the element at index \( k \) from \( l \) concatenated with \( t \). This is because the prefix relationship is preserved when removing elements at the same index from both lists.

2. **Case 2: \( k \) is greater than or equal to the length of \( l \):**
- Since \( k \) is not less than the length of \( l \), it follows that \( k \) is greater than or equal to the length of \( l \). Using this, we can simplify the goal by noting that removing the element at index \( k \) from \( l \) results in \( l \) itself, and removing the element at index \( k \) from \( l \) concatenated with \( t \) results in \( l \) concatenated with the list obtained by removing the element at index \( k - \text{length}(l) \) from \( t \). Therefore, the goal is to show that \( l \) is a prefix of \( l \) concatenated with the list obtained by removing the element at index \( k - \text{length}(l) \) from \( t \), which is trivially true.

In both cases, the goal is satisfied, and thus the theorem is proved.
