1. **Informal Theorem**  
Pairwise Relation on a Singleton List: \([a]\) is Pairwise \( R \) : For any type \( \alpha \) and any binary relation \( R \) on \( \alpha \), the list \([a]\) consisting of a single element \( a \) satisfies the pairwise relation \( R \). In other words, the list \([a]\) is pairwise \( R \)-related.

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that the list \([a]\) is pairwise \( R \)-related, we need to show that for any two distinct elements \( x \) and \( y \) in the list, \( R(x, y) \) holds. However, the list \([a]\) contains only one element \( a \), and there are no pairs of distinct elements to check. Therefore, the pairwise relation \( R \) is trivially satisfied. Hence, the list \([a]\) is pairwise \( R \)-related. This completes the proof.
