1. **Informal Theorem**  
Element at Index in Sublist Equals Element at Same Index in Original List : For any type $\alpha$, any list $l$ of elements of type $\alpha$, and any natural numbers $m$ and $n$ such that $m < n$, the $m$-th element of the list obtained by taking the first $n$ elements of $l$ is equal to the $m$-th element of $l$ itself, i.e., $(\text{take } n \, l).get? \, m = l.get? \, m$.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We need to show that for any type \(\alpha\), any list \(l\) of elements of type \(\alpha\), and any natural numbers \(m\) and \(n\) such that \(m < n\), the \(m\)-th element of the list obtained by taking the first \(n\) elements of \(l\) is equal to the \(m\)-th element of \(l\) itself.

Using the theorem that the \(m\)-th element of the list obtained by taking the first \(n\) elements of \(l\) is equal to the \(m\)-th element of \(l\) itself, and the hypothesis that \(m < n\), we can simplify the proposition we want to show to \((\text{take } n \, l).get? \, m = l.get? \, m\). This simplification directly proves the goal.

Thus, the theorem is proved. \(\blacksquare\)
