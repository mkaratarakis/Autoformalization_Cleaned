1. **Informal Theorem**  
Pairwise Relations Combine under Conjunction: \( \text{Pairwise } R \land \text{Pairwise } S \to \text{Pairwise } (R \land S) \) : For any type \( \alpha \) and any two relations \( R \) and \( S \) on \( \alpha \), if a list \( l \) of elements of type \( \alpha \) is pairwise \( R \)-related and pairwise \( S \)-related, then \( l \) is pairwise \((R \land S)\)-related. In other words, if for all elements \( a \) and \( b \) in \( l \) where \( a \) appears before \( b \), both \( R(a, b) \) and \( S(a, b) \) hold, then \( (R \land S)(a, b) \) also holds for all such pairs.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We proceed by induction on the list \( l \).

1. **Base Case:**
- If \( l \) is the empty list, the pairwise \((R \land S)\)-related property holds trivially, as there are no elements to compare. This is a direct consequence of the definition of the pairwise property for an empty list.

2. **Inductive Step:**
- Assume \( l \) is a non-empty list of the form \( a :: l' \), where \( a \) is the first element and \( l' \) is the rest of the list.
- We need to show that \( l \) is pairwise \((R \land S)\)-related.
- By the induction hypothesis, \( l' \) is pairwise \((R \land S)\)-related.
- We also have the hypotheses that \( l \) is pairwise \( R \)-related and pairwise \( S \)-related.
- Specifically, for every element \( b \) in \( l' \), \( R(a, b) \) and \( S(a, b) \) hold.
- Therefore, for every element \( b \) in \( l' \), \( (R \land S)(a, b) \) holds.
- Combining this with the induction hypothesis, we conclude that \( l \) is pairwise \((R \land S)\)-related.

Thus, we have shown that if a list \( l \) is pairwise \( R \)-related and pairwise \( S \)-related, then \( l \) is pairwise \((R \land S)\)-related. This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
