1. **Informal Theorem**  
First Element of `dropWhile` Result Does Not Satisfy Predicate: $p(\text{head}(\text{dropWhile}(p, l))) = \text{false}$ : For any type $\alpha$ and any predicate $p : \alpha \to \text{Bool}$, if the list $l : \text{List} \, \alpha$ is non-empty after applying `List.dropWhile p` to it, then the first element of the resulting list does not satisfy the predicate $p$, i.e., $p(\text{head}(\text{dropWhile}(p, l))) = \text{false}$.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We need to show that if the list $l$ is non-empty after applying `List.dropWhile p` to it, then the first element of the resulting list does not satisfy the predicate $p$.

First, we use the fact that the optional head of a non-empty list is `some` of its first element. This means that if the list `List.dropWhile p l` is non-empty, then `List.head? (List.dropWhile p l)` is `some (List.head (List.dropWhile p l) w)`, where `w` is a proof that `List.dropWhile p l` is non-empty.

Next, we use the fact that the first element of the list resulting from `List.dropWhile p l` does not satisfy the predicate $p$. This means that if `List.dropWhile p l` is non-empty, then $p(\text{head}(\text{dropWhile}(p, l))) = \text{false}$.

Combining these two facts, we can simplify the proposition we want to show to $p(\text{head}(\text{dropWhile}(p, l))) = \text{false}$. We see that this is exactly what we have proved, thus completing the proof. $\blacksquare$
