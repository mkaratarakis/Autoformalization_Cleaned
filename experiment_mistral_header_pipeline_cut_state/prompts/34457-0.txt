1. **Informal Theorem**  
Pairwise Implication for List Elements: \(\text{Pairwise } R \, l \to \text{Pairwise } S \, l\) : For any list \( l \) of elements of type \( \alpha \) and any relations \( R \) and \( S \) on \( \alpha \), if for all elements \( a \) and \( b \) in \( l \), \( a \in l \) and \( b \in l \) and \( R a b \) imply \( S a b \), then the pairwise relation \( R \) holding on \( l \) implies the pairwise relation \( S \) also holds on \( l \). In other words, if \( R \) implies \( S \) for all pairs of elements in \( l \), then \( \text{Pairwise } R \, l \) implies \( \text{Pairwise } S \, l \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We prove this by induction on the list \( l \).

1. **Base Case:**
- If \( l \) is the empty list, the pairwise relation \( S \) trivially holds for the empty list. This is because there are no elements to compare, and thus the condition is vacuously true.

2. **Inductive Step:**
- Assume \( l \) is a list of the form \( a :: l \), where \( a \) is an element of type \( \alpha \) and \( l \) is a list of elements of type \( \alpha \).
- We need to show that the pairwise relation \( S \) holds for the list \( a :: l \).
- To do this, we need to show two things:
1. For any element \( a' \) in \( l \), \( S a a' \) holds.
2. The pairwise relation \( S \) holds for the list \( l \).

- **First Part:**
- For any element \( a' \) in \( l \), since \( a \) is a member of \( a :: l \) and \( a' \) is a member of \( a :: l \) (because \( a' \in l \)), and \( R a a' \) holds by the hypothesis \( r \), it follows that \( S a a' \) holds by the hypothesis \( H \).

- **Second Part:**
- To show that the pairwise relation \( S \) holds for the list \( l \), we use the induction hypothesis \( \text{ih} \). Specifically, for any elements \( m \) and \( m' \) in \( l \), if \( m \in l \) and \( m' \in l \), and \( R m m' \) holds, then \( S m m' \) must also hold. This is because \( m \) and \( m' \) are also members of the list \( a :: l \), and by the hypothesis \( H \), \( R m m' \) implies \( S m m' \).

By induction, we have shown that if \( R \) implies \( S \) for all pairs of elements in \( l \), then \( \text{Pairwise } R \, l \) implies \( \text{Pairwise } S \, l \). This completes the proof.
