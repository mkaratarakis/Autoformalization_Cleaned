1. **Informal Theorem**  
Removing Last Element is Equivalent to Taking All but the Last Element : For any list \( l \) of elements of type \( \alpha \), the list obtained by removing the last element of \( l \) is equal to the list of the first \( \text{length}(l) - 1 \) elements of \( l \). In other words, \( l.\text{dropLast} = \text{take}(\text{length}(l) - 1, l) \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We prove this by induction on the list \( l \).

**Base Case:**
For the empty list \( l = [] \):
- The left-hand side is \( \text{dropLast}([]) \), which is defined as \( [] \).
- The right-hand side is \( \text{take}(\text{length}([]) - 1, []) \), which is \( \text{take}(0 - 1, []) \). Since the length of the empty list is \( 0 \), this simplifies to \( \text{take}(-1, []) \), which is \( [] \).
- Therefore, \( \text{dropLast}([]) = \text{take}(\text{length}([]) - 1, []) \).

**Inductive Step:**
Assume the statement holds for a list \( l \), i.e., \( l.\text{dropLast} = \text{take}(\text{length}(l) - 1, l) \). We need to show that the statement holds for the list \( x :: l \), where \( x \) is an element of type \( \alpha \).

- The left-hand side is \( (x :: l).\text{dropLast} \), which is defined as \( x :: \text{dropLast}(l) \).
- The right-hand side is \( \text{take}((x :: l).\text{length} - 1, x :: l) \). Since the length of \( x :: l \) is \( \text{length}(l) + 1 \), this simplifies to \( \text{take}((\text{length}(l) + 1) - 1, x :: l) \), which is \( \text{take}(\text{length}(l), x :: l) \).
- By the definition of `take`, \( \text{take}(\text{length}(l), x :: l) \) is \( x :: \text{take}(\text{length}(l) - 1, l) \).
- By the inductive hypothesis, \( \text{dropLast}(l) = \text{take}(\text{length}(l) - 1, l) \).
- Therefore, \( x :: \text{dropLast}(l) = x :: \text{take}(\text{length}(l) - 1, l) \), which is \( \text{take}(\text{length}(l), x :: l) \).

Thus, the statement holds for \( x :: l \).

By induction, the theorem is true for all lists \( l \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
