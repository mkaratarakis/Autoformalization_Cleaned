1. **Informal Theorem**  
Condition for Dropped List to be Empty: \(\text{drop}(k, l) = [] \leftrightarrow \text{length}(l) \le k\) : For any list \( l \) of elements of type \( \alpha \) and any natural number \( k \), the list obtained by dropping the first \( k \) elements from \( l \) is empty if and only if the length of \( l \) is less than or equal to \( k \), i.e., \(\text{drop}(k, l) = [] \leftrightarrow \text{length}(l) \le k\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the equivalence \(\text{drop}(k, l) = [] \leftrightarrow \text{length}(l) \le k\), we need to show both directions.

1. **(\(\Rightarrow\))**: Assume \(\text{drop}(k, l) = []\). We need to show that \(\text{length}(l) \le k\).

- **Base Case**: \(k = 0\).
- If \(\text{drop}(0, l) = []\), then by the definition of \(\text{drop}\), \(l = []\).
- The length of \(l\) is \(0\), which is clearly less than or equal to \(0\).

- **Inductive Step**: Assume \(k = k' + 1\) and that the statement holds for \(k'\). We need to show that if \(\text{drop}(k' + 1, l) = []\), then \(\text{length}(l) \le k' + 1\).
- Consider two cases for \(l\):
- **Case 1**: \(l = []\).
- \(\text{drop}(k' + 1, []) = []\) is trivially true, and the length of \(l\) is \(0\), which is less than or equal to \(k' + 1\).
- **Case 2**: \(l = \text{head} :: \text{tail}\).
- Using the definition of \(\text{drop}\), \(\text{drop}(k' + 1, \text{head} :: \text{tail}) = \text{drop}(k', \text{tail})\).
- By the induction hypothesis, \(\text{drop}(k', \text{tail}) = []\) implies \(\text{length}(\text{tail}) \le k'\).
- Since \(\text{length}(l) = \text{length}(\text{tail}) + 1\), we have \(\text{length}(l) \le k' + 1\).

2. **(\(\Leftarrow\))**: Assume \(\text{length}(l) \le k\). We need to show that \(\text{drop}(k, l) = []\).

- This is given by the theorem that if \(\text{length}(l) \le k\), then \(\text{drop}(k, l) = []\).

Thus, we have shown both directions, completing the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
