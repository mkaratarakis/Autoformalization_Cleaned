1. **Informal Theorem**  
Take-While and Map Commute: $\text{takeWhile}(p, \text{map}(f, l)) = \text{map}(f, \text{takeWhile}(p \circ f, l))$ : For any types $\alpha$ and $\beta$, any function $f : \alpha \to \beta$, any predicate $p : \beta \to \text{Bool}$, and any list $l : \text{List} \, \alpha$, the following equality holds:
\[
\text{takeWhile}(p, \text{map}(f, l)) = \text{map}(f, \text{takeWhile}(p \circ f, l)).
\]
This means that applying the predicate $p$ to the elements of the list after mapping them with $f$ and taking the longest initial segment that satisfies $p$ is the same as first taking the longest initial segment of $l$ that satisfies the composed predicate $p \circ f$ and then mapping the elements of this segment with $f$.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We prove this by induction on the list \(l\).

1. **Base Case:**
For the base case where the list is empty, the equality holds trivially due to the reflexive property of equality. Specifically, both sides of the equation are the empty list:
\[
\text{takeWhile}(p, \text{map}(f, [])) = \text{map}(f, \text{takeWhile}(p \circ f, [])).
\]
Both sides are \([]\).

2. **Inductive Step:**
Assume the list is of the form \( x :: xs \) and that the property holds for the list \( xs \). We need to show that the property holds for the list \( x :: xs \).

Using the definitions of `map` and `takeWhile` on a cons list, we simplify the proposition we want to show to:
\[
\text{if } p(f(x)) = \text{true} \text{ then } f(x) :: \text{takeWhile}(p, \text{map}(f, xs)) \text{ else } []
\]
is equal to
\[
\text{map}(f, \text{if } (p \circ f)(x) = \text{true} \text{ then } x :: \text{takeWhile}(p \circ f, xs) \text{ else } []).
\]

We discuss by cases based on the condition \( p(f(x)) = \text{true} \):

- **Case 1: \( p(f(x)) = \text{true} \):**
In this case, the left-hand side becomes:
\[
f(x) :: \text{takeWhile}(p, \text{map}(f, xs)),
\]
and the right-hand side becomes:
\[
\text{map}(f, x :: \text{takeWhile}(p \circ f, xs)) = f(x) :: \text{map}(f, \text{takeWhile}(p \circ f, xs)).
\]
By the inductive hypothesis, we have:
\[
\text{takeWhile}(p, \text{map}(f, xs)) = \text{map}(f, \text{takeWhile}(p \circ f, xs)).
\]
Therefore, both sides are equal.

- **Case 2: \( p(f(x)) = \text{false} \):**
In this case, the left-hand side becomes:
\[
[],
\]
and the right-hand side becomes:
\[
\text{map}(f, []).
\]
Both sides are \([]\).

In both cases, the equality holds. Therefore, by induction, the property holds for all lists \( l \).

This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
