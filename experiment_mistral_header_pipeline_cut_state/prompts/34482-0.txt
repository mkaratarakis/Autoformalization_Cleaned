1. **Informal Theorem**  
TakeWhile of Concatenated Lists with Positive Predicate on First List: \(\text{takeWhile } p \, (l_1 ++ l_2) = l_1 ++ \text{takeWhile } p \, l_2\) : For any type \( \alpha \) and any predicate \( p : \alpha \to \text{Bool} \), and for any lists \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \) of elements of type \( \alpha \), if every element \( a \) in \( l_1 \) satisfies \( p(a) = \text{true} \), then the longest initial segment of the concatenated list \( l_1 ++ l_2 \) for which \( p \) returns `true` is given by:
\[ \text{takeWhile } p \, (l_1 ++ l_2) = l_1 ++ \text{takeWhile } p \, l_2. \]

2. **Informal Proof**  
We prove this by induction on the list \( l_1 \).

**Base Case:**
Consider \( l_1 = [] \). We need to show:
\[ \text{takeWhile } p \, ([] ++ l_2) = [] ++ \text{takeWhile } p \, l_2. \]
Since the concatenation of the empty list with any list \( l_2 \) is just \( l_2 \), the left-hand side simplifies to:
\[ \text{takeWhile } p \, l_2. \]
The right-hand side is:
\[ [] ++ \text{takeWhile } p \, l_2 = \text{takeWhile } p \, l_2. \]
Thus, the base case holds trivially.

**Inductive Case:**
Assume the statement holds for some list \( xs \), i.e.,
\[ \text{takeWhile } p \, (xs ++ l_2) = xs ++ \text{takeWhile } p \, l_2. \]
We need to show that the statement holds for \( l_1 = x :: xs \). Specifically, we need to show:
\[ \text{takeWhile } p \, ((x :: xs) ++ l_2) = (x :: xs) ++ \text{takeWhile } p \, l_2. \]
By the definition of `takeWhile`, the left-hand side can be expanded as:
\[ \text{takeWhile } p \, (x :: (xs ++ l_2)). \]
Since \( p(x) = \text{true} \) (by the hypothesis that every element in \( l_1 \) satisfies \( p \)), the `takeWhile` function will include \( x \) and then continue to process the rest of the list:
\[ \text{takeWhile } p \, (x :: (xs ++ l_2)) = x :: \text{takeWhile } p \, (xs ++ l_2). \]
By the inductive hypothesis, we know that:
\[ \text{takeWhile } p \, (xs ++ l_2) = xs ++ \text{takeWhile } p \, l_2. \]
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
\[ x :: \text{takeWhile } p \, (xs ++ l_2) = x :: (xs ++ \text{takeWhile } p \, l_2). \]
This simplifies to:
\[ (x :: xs) ++ \text{takeWhile } p \, l_2. \]
Thus, the inductive case holds.

By induction, the theorem is proved.
