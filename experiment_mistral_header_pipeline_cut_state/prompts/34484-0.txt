1. **Informal Theorem**  
First Element of `dropWhile` Result is Not Satisfying Predicate : For any type $\alpha$ and any predicate $p : \alpha \to \text{Bool}$, if the list $l : \text{List} \, \alpha$ is non-empty after applying `List.dropWhile p` to it, then the first element of the resulting list satisfies $p(x) = \text{false}$. If the resulting list is empty, the statement is trivially true.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We proceed by induction on the list \( l \).

1. **Base Case:**
- If the list \( l \) is empty, the result is trivially true because the `head?` of an empty list is `none`, and the statement \( p(x) = \text{false} \) is vacuously true.

2. **Inductive Step:**
- Suppose the list \( l \) is non-empty and can be written as \( x :: xs \). We use the induction hypothesis \( ih \) which states that the result holds for the list \( xs \).

- We consider two cases based on the condition \( p(x) = \text{true} \) or \( p(x) = \text{false} \):
- **Case 1: \( p(x) = \text{true} \)**
- In this case, the result of `dropWhile p (x :: xs)` is `dropWhile p xs`.
- By the induction hypothesis \( ih \), the first element of `dropWhile p xs` satisfies \( p(x) = \text{false} \).

- **Case 2: \( p(x) = \text{false} \)**
- In this case, the result of `dropWhile p (x :: xs)` is \( x :: xs \).
- The first element of \( x :: xs \) is \( x \), and by the condition \( p(x) = \text{false} \), the statement holds.

In both cases, the result follows from the properties of the `dropWhile` function and the induction hypothesis. Therefore, the theorem is proved. \(\blacksquare\)
