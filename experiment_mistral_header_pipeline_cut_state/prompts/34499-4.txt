Below are the error message and proof state for the proof you generated. Please revise the proof accordingly starting with new prefix. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
6. **Error Message and Proof State**
tmp.lean:12:4: error: no goals to be solved
tmp.lean:21:25: error: expected type must not contain free variables
  k = 0
Use the '+revert' option to automatically cleanup and revert free variables.

  ih.mp h
argument
  h
