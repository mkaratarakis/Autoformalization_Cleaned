1. **Informal Theorem**  
Drop While Preserves Filter Map in Lists : For any types \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \), a function \( f : \alpha \to \text{Option} \beta \), a predicate \( p : \beta \to \text{Bool} \), and a list \( l \) of elements of type \( \alpha \), the following equality holds:
\[
\text{dropWhile } p \, (\text{filterMap } f \, l) = \text{filterMap } f \, (\text{dropWhile } (\lambda a, \, \text{Option.all } p \, (f \, a)) \, l)
\]
This theorem states that applying `dropWhile` to a predicate \( p \) on the result of `filterMap` applied to \( f \) and \( l \) is equivalent to applying `filterMap` to \( f \) on the result of `dropWhile` applied to a modified predicate that checks if \( p \) holds for the optional value returned by \( f \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We prove the theorem by induction on the list \( l \).

1. **Base Case:**
- If \( l \) is the empty list, then both sides of the equation are the empty list. Therefore, the goal is trivially true.

2. **Inductive Step:**
- Assume \( l = x :: xs \) and the inductive hypothesis \( \text{dropWhile } p \, (\text{filterMap } f \, xs) = \text{filterMap } f \, (\text{dropWhile } (\lambda a, \, \text{Option.all } p \, (f \, a)) \, xs) \).
- We need to show:
\[
\text{dropWhile } p \, (\text{filterMap } f \, (x :: xs)) = \text{filterMap } f \, (\text{dropWhile } (\lambda a, \, \text{Option.all } p \, (f \, a)) \, (x :: xs))
\]
- We consider two cases based on the result of \( f \, x \):
- **Case 1: \( f \, x = \text{none} \)**
- The left-hand side becomes:
\[
\text{dropWhile } p \, (\text{filterMap } f \, xs)
\]
- The right-hand side becomes:
\[
\text{filterMap } f \, (\text{if } \text{Option.all } p \, \text{none} = \text{true} \, \text{then } \text{dropWhile } (\lambda a, \, \text{Option.all } p \, (f \, a)) \, xs \, \text{else } x :: xs)
\]
- We consider two sub-cases:
- **Sub-case 1.1: \( \text{Option.all } p \, \text{none} = \text{true} \)**
- The right-hand side simplifies to:
\[
\text{filterMap } f \, (\text{dropWhile } (\lambda a, \, \text{Option.all } p \, (f \, a)) \, xs)
\]
- By the inductive hypothesis, this is equal to:
\[
\text{dropWhile } p \, (\text{filterMap } f \, xs)
\]
- **Sub-case 1.2: \( \text{Option.all } p \, \text{none} = \text{false} \)**
- The right-hand side simplifies to:
\[
\text{filterMap } f \, (x :: xs)
\]
- By the definition of `filterMap`, this is equal to:
\[
\text{filterMap } f \, xs
\]
- By the inductive hypothesis, this is equal to:
\[
\text{dropWhile } p \, (\text{filterMap } f \, xs)
\]
- **Case 2: \( f \, x = \text{some } b \)**
- The left-hand side becomes:
\[
\text{dropWhile } p \, (b :: \text{filterMap } f \, xs)
\]
- The right-hand side becomes:
\[
\text{filterMap } f \, (\text{if } p \, b = \text{true} \, \text{then } \text{dropWhile } (\lambda a, \, \text{Option.all } p \, (f \, a)) \, xs \, \text{else } x :: xs)
\]
- We consider two sub-cases:
- **Sub-case 2.1: \( p \, b = \text{true} \)**
- The right-hand side simplifies to:
\[
\text{filterMap } f \, (\text{dropWhile } (\lambda a, \, \text{Option.all } p \, (f \, a)) \, xs)
\]
- By the inductive hypothesis, this is equal to:
\[
\text{dropWhile } p \, (\text{filterMap } f \, xs)
\]
- **Sub-case 2.2: \( p \, b = \text{false} \)**
- The right-hand side simplifies to:
\[
\text{filterMap } f \, (x :: xs)
\]
- By the definition of `filterMap`, this is equal to:
\[
b :: \text{filterMap } f \, xs
\]
- By the inductive hypothesis, this is equal to:
\[
\text{dropWhile } p \, (b :: \text{filterMap } f \, xs)
\]

Thus, the theorem holds for all lists \( l \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
