1. **Informal Theorem**  
Sublist Preservation under Filter: \( l_1 \subseteq l_2 \implies \text{filter } p \, l_1 \subseteq \text{filter } p \, l_2 \) : For any types \( \alpha \) and any predicate \( p : \alpha \to \text{Bool} \), if \( l_1 \) is a sublist of \( l_2 \), then the list obtained by filtering \( l_1 \) with \( p \) is a sublist of the list obtained by filtering \( l_2 \) with \( p \). In other words, if \( l_1 \subseteq l_2 \), then \( \text{filter } p \, l_1 \subseteq \text{filter } p \, l_2 \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the theorem, we start by noting that the filter operation on a list can be expressed as a filter map operation. Specifically, we use the equivalence that \( \text{filter } p \, l = \text{filterMap } p \, l \). This allows us to rewrite the goal from showing that the filtered list of \( l_1 \) is a sublist of the filtered list of \( l_2 \) to showing that the filter map of \( l_1 \) is a sublist of the filter map of \( l_2 \).

Given that \( l_1 \) is a sublist of \( l_2 \), we can apply the property that if \( l_1 \) is a sublist of \( l_2 \), then the filter map of \( l_1 \) is a sublist of the filter map of \( l_2 \). Therefore, we conclude that \( \text{filter } p \, l_1 \) is a sublist of \( \text{filter } p \, l_2 \).

This completes the proof.
