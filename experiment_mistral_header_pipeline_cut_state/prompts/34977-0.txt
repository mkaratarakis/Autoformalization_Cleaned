1. **Informal Theorem**  
Replicated List is a Subset if and Only If \( n = 0 \) or \( a \in l \) : For any type \( \alpha \), natural number \( n \), element \( a \in \alpha \), and list \( l \) of elements of type \( \alpha \), the list \(\text{replicate } n \, a\) is a subset of \( l \) if and only if \( n = 0 \) or \( a \in l \). In other words, \(\{a, a, \ldots, a\} \subseteq l\) (where the list contains \( n \) copies of \( a \)) if and only if \( n = 0 \) or \( a \) is an element of \( l \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We prove this by induction on \( n \).

**Base Case:**
Consider \( n = 0 \). We need to show that \(\text{replicate } 0 \, a \subseteq l\) if and only if \( 0 = 0 \) or \( a \in l \). Since \(\text{replicate } 0 \, a\) is the empty list, it is a subset of any list \( l \). Therefore, the left-hand side of the equivalence is always true. The right-hand side is also always true because \( 0 = 0 \) is true. Hence, the equivalence holds.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume the inductive hypothesis that \(\text{replicate } k \, a \subseteq l\) if and only if \( k = 0 \) or \( a \in l \). We need to show that \(\text{replicate } (k + 1) \, a \subseteq l\) if and only if \( k + 1 = 0 \) or \( a \in l \).

Using the definition of \(\text{replicate}\), we have \(\text{replicate } (k + 1) \, a = a :: \text{replicate } k \, a\). Therefore, \(\text{replicate } (k + 1) \, a \subseteq l\) if and only if \( a \in l \) and \(\text{replicate } k \, a \subseteq l \).

By the inductive hypothesis, \(\text{replicate } k \, a \subseteq l\) if and only if \( k = 0 \) or \( a \in l \). Combining these, we get:
- If \( k + 1 = 0 \), then \( k = -1 \), which is impossible since \( k \) is a natural number.
- If \( a \in l \), then \(\text{replicate } k \, a \subseteq l\) holds by the inductive hypothesis.

Thus, \(\text{replicate } (k + 1) \, a \subseteq l\) if and only if \( a \in l \). This completes the inductive step.

By induction, the theorem holds for all natural numbers \( n \). Therefore, the list \(\text{replicate } n \, a\) is a subset of \( l \) if and only if \( n = 0 \) or \( a \in l \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
