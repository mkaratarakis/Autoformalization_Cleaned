1. **Informal Theorem**  
Non-empty List is Not a Prefix of the Empty List: \( 0 < |L| \implies L.\text{isPrefixOf} [] = \text{false} \) : For any type \( \alpha \) and any list \( L \) of elements of type \( \alpha \), if the length of \( L \) is greater than 0, then \( L \) is not a prefix of the empty list. This can be written as:
\[
0 < |L| \implies L.\text{isPrefixOf} [] = \text{false}
\]
where \( |L| \) denotes the length of the list \( L \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We will consider every possible case of the list \( L \).

**Case 1: \( L \) is the empty list.**
- The assumption \( 0 < |L| \) becomes \( 0 < 0 \), which is false. Therefore, this case is vacuously true.
- We need to show that \( L.\text{isPrefixOf} [] = \text{false} \). Since \( L \) is the empty list, \( L.\text{isPrefixOf} [] \) is \( \text{true} \) by definition. However, this case is vacuously true because the assumption \( 0 < |L| \) is false.

**Case 2: \( L \) is a non-empty list, i.e., \( L = \text{head} :: \text{tail} \).**
- The assumption \( 0 < |L| \) becomes \( 0 < 1 + |\text{tail}| \), which is true.
- We need to show that \( (\text{head} :: \text{tail}).\text{isPrefixOf} [] = \text{false} \). By the definition of `isPrefixOf`, if the second list is empty and the first list is non-empty, then \( \text{isPrefixOf} \) returns `false`. Therefore, \( (\text{head} :: \text{tail}).\text{isPrefixOf} [] = \text{false} \).

In both cases, the statement holds. Therefore, we have shown that if the length of \( L \) is greater than 0, then \( L \) is not a prefix of the empty list. This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
