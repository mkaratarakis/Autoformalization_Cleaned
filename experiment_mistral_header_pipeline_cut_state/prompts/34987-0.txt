1. **Informal Theorem**  
Sublist Preservation under Mapping: \( l_1 \subseteq l_2 \implies \text{map } f \, l_1 \subseteq \text{map } f \, l_2 \) : For any types \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \), and for any function \( f : \alpha \to \beta \), if \( l_1 \) is a sublist of \( l_2 \), then the list obtained by applying `map` to \( l_1 \) is a sublist of the list obtained by applying `map` to \( l_2 \). In other words, if \( l_1 \subseteq l_2 \), then \( \text{map } f \, l_1 \subseteq \text{map } f \, l_2 \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We prove this by induction on the structure of the sublist relation.

1. **Base Case:**
- Consider the case where \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \) are both empty lists. The map of an empty list is an empty list, so \( \text{map } f \, [] = [] \). Since the empty list is a sublist of itself, the base case is trivially true.

2. **Inductive Step:**
- **Case 1:**
- Assume \( l_1 = a :: l_1' \) and \( l_2 = a :: l_2' \), and \( l_1' \) is a sublist of \( l_2' \). By the induction hypothesis, \( \text{map } f \, l_1' \) is a sublist of \( \text{map } f \, l_2' \). Using the property that if \( l_1' \) is a sublist of \( l_2' \), then adding the same element \( f(a) \) to the front of both lists results in \( f(a) :: \text{map } f \, l_1' \) being a sublist of \( f(a) :: \text{map } f \, l_2' \), we have \( \text{map } f \, (a :: l_1') \) is a sublist of \( \text{map } f \, (a :: l_2') \). This completes the proof for this case.
- **Case 2:**
- Assume \( l_1 = a :: l_1' \) and \( l_2 = a :: l_2' \), and \( l_1' \) is a sublist of \( l_2' \). By the induction hypothesis, \( \text{map } f \, l_1' \) is a sublist of \( \text{map } f \, l_2' \). Using the property that if \( l_1' \) is a sublist of \( l_2' \), then adding the same element \( f(a) \) to the front of both lists results in \( f(a) :: \text{map } f \, l_1' \) being a sublist of \( f(a) :: \text{map } f \, l_2' \), we have \( \text{map } f \, (a :: l_1') \) is a sublist of \( \text{map } f \, (a :: l_2') \). This completes the proof for this case.

By induction, we have shown that if \( l_1 \) is a sublist of \( l_2 \), then \( \text{map } f \, l_1 \) is a sublist of \( \text{map } f \, l_2 \). This completes the proof.
