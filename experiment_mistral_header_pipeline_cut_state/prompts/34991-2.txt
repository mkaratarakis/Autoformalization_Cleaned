4. **New Prefix**  
   The initial Lean 4 code that you must build on.
import Init.Data.List.TakeDrop
import Init.Data.List.Sublist

open List
open Nat
variable [BEq α]
variable [BEq α]

example {m n} (a : α) :
    replicate m a <+ replicate n a ↔ m ≤ n := by
  constructor
  · intro h
    have hlen : m ≤ n := by
