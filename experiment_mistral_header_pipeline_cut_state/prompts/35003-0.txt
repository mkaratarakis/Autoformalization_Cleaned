1. **Informal Theorem**  
List is a Prefix of Replicated List if and only if Length Condition and All Elements are Equal: \( l.\text{isPrefixOf} (\text{replicate } n \, a) \leftrightarrow (|l| \le n \, \text{and} \, \forall x \in l, \, x = a) \) : For any type \( \alpha \) and any list \( l \) of elements of type \( \alpha \), and for any natural number \( n \) and any element \( a \) of type \( \alpha \), the list \( l \) is a prefix of the list `replicate n a` if and only if the length of \( l \) is less than or equal to \( n \) and every element in \( l \) is equal to \( a \). Formally, this can be written as:
\[
l.\text{isPrefixOf} (\text{replicate } n \, a) = (\text{decide } (|l| \le n) \, \text{and} \, \forall x \in l, \, x = a)
\]
where \( |l| \) denotes the length of the list \( l \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We prove this by induction on the list \( l \).

**Base Case:**
Consider the case where \( l \) is the empty list. We need to show that the empty list is a prefix of `replicate n a` if and only if the length of the empty list is less than or equal to \( n \) and every element in the empty list is equal to \( a \). This is trivially true because the length of the empty list is \( 0 \), which is always less than or equal to any natural number \( n \), and the condition on elements is vacuously true.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume the induction hypothesis: for any natural number \( m \), \( t \) is a prefix of `replicate m a` if and only if the length of \( t \) is less than or equal to \( m \) and every element in \( t \) is equal to \( a \).

Consider the list \( l = h :: t \). We need to show that \( h :: t \) is a prefix of `replicate n a` if and only if the length of \( h :: t \) is less than or equal to \( n \) and every element in \( h :: t \) is equal to \( a \).

We perform case analysis on \( n \):

1. **Case \( n = 0 \):**
- The goal is to show that \( h :: t \) is a prefix of the empty list if and only if the length of \( h :: t \) is less than or equal to \( 0 \) and every element in \( h :: t \) is equal to \( a \). This is trivially false because the length of \( h :: t \) is at least \( 1 \), which is not less than or equal to \( 0 \).

2. **Case \( n = m + 1 \):**
- The goal is to show that \( h :: t \) is a prefix of `a :: replicate m a` if and only if \( h = a \) and \( t \) is a prefix of `replicate m a`.
- By the definition of `isPrefixOf`, \( h :: t \) is a prefix of `a :: replicate m a` if and only if \( h = a \) and \( t \) is a prefix of `replicate m a`.
- By the induction hypothesis, \( t \) is a prefix of `replicate m a` if and only if the length of \( t \) is less than or equal to \( m \) and every element in \( t \) is equal to \( a \).
- Therefore, \( h :: t \) is a prefix of `a :: replicate m a` if and only if \( h = a \) and the length of \( t \) is less than or equal to \( m \) and every element in \( t \) is equal to \( a \).

This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
