1. **Informal Theorem**  
Suffix of Cons List: \( l_1 \text{ is a suffix of } a :: l_2 \iff l_1 = a :: l_2 \lor l_1 \text{ is a suffix of } l_2 \) : For any lists \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \) of elements of type \( \alpha \) and any element \( a \) of type \( \alpha \), the list \( l_1 \) is a suffix of the list \( a :: l_2 \) if and only if \( l_1 \) is equal to \( a :: l_2 \) or \( l_1 \) is a suffix of \( l_2 \). This can be written as:
\[ l_1 \text{ is a suffix of } a :: l_2 \iff l_1 = a :: l_2 \lor l_1 \text{ is a suffix of } l_2. \]

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the equivalence, we need to show both directions of the implication.

1. **(\(\Rightarrow\)) If \( l_1 \) is a suffix of \( a :: l_2 \), then \( l_1 = a :: l_2 \) or \( l_1 \) is a suffix of \( l_2 \):**
- Assume \( l_1 \) is a suffix of \( a :: l_2 \). This means there exist lists \( \text{hd} \) and \( \text{tl} \) such that \( \text{hd} :: \text{tl} ++ l_1 = a :: l_2 \).
- Simplify the equation to \( \text{hd} :: (\text{tl} ++ l_1) = a :: l_2 \).
- By the injectivity of the cons operation, we have \( \text{hd} = a \) and \( \text{tl} ++ l_1 = l_2 \).
- Therefore, \( l_1 = a :: l_2 \) or \( l_1 \) is a suffix of \( l_2 \).

2. **(\(\Leftarrow\)) If \( l_1 = a :: l_2 \) or \( l_1 \) is a suffix of \( l_2 \), then \( l_1 \) is a suffix of \( a :: l_2 \):**
- **Case 1:** If \( l_1 = a :: l_2 \), then \( l_1 \) is a suffix of \( a :: l_2 \) by the reflexivity of the suffix relation.
- **Case 2:** If \( l_1 \) is a suffix of \( l_2 \), then \( l_1 \) is a suffix of \( a :: l_2 \) by the transitivity of the suffix relation, since \( l_2 \) is a suffix of \( a :: l_2 \).

Thus, we have shown both directions of the equivalence, completing the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
