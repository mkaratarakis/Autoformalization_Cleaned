1. **Informal Theorem**  
Sublist of Replicated List Characterization : For any list \( l \) of elements of type \( \alpha \), and for any natural number \( m \) and element \( a \) of type \( \alpha \), the list \( l \) is a sublist of the list containing \( m \) copies of \( a \) if and only if there exists a natural number \( n \) such that \( n \leq m \) and \( l \) is equal to the list containing \( n \) copies of \( a \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We prove the theorem by induction on the list \( l \).

1. **Base Case:**
- If \( l \) is the empty list, we need to show that the empty list is a sublist of \( \text{replicate}(m, a) \) if and only if there exists \( n \) such that \( n \leq m \) and the empty list is equal to \( \text{replicate}(n, a) \).
- The empty list is a sublist of any list, and \( \text{replicate}(0, a) \) is the empty list. Therefore, the base case holds with \( n = 0 \).

2. **Inductive Step:**
- Assume the inductive hypothesis: for any list \( l' \) and any natural number \( m \), \( l' \) is a sublist of \( \text{replicate}(m, a) \) if and only if there exists \( n \) such that \( n \leq m \) and \( l' = \text{replicate}(n, a) \).
- Consider the list \( l = b :: l' \).

- **Direction 1:**
- Suppose \( b :: l' \) is a sublist of \( \text{replicate}(m, a) \).
- By the inductive hypothesis, \( l' \) is a sublist of \( \text{replicate}(m, a) \), so there exists \( n \) such that \( n \leq m \) and \( l' = \text{replicate}(n, a) \).
- Since \( b \) is a member of \( \text{replicate}(m, a) \), it follows that \( b = a \).
- Therefore, \( b :: l' = a :: \text{replicate}(n, a) = \text{replicate}(n + 1, a) \).
- Since \( n + 1 \leq m + 1 \), \( b :: l' \) is a sublist of \( \text{replicate}(m + 1, a) \).

- **Direction 2:**
- Suppose there exists \( n \) such that \( n \leq m \) and \( b :: l' = \text{replicate}(n, a) \).
- Since \( b :: l' = \text{replicate}(n, a) \), it follows that \( b = a \) and \( l' = \text{replicate}(n - 1, a) \).
- By the inductive hypothesis, \( l' \) is a sublist of \( \text{replicate}(m, a) \).
- Therefore, \( b :: l' = a :: \text{replicate}(n - 1, a) = \text{replicate}(n, a) \) is a sublist of \( \text{replicate}(m, a) \).

This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
