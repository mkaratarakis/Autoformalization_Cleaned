1. **Informal Theorem**  
Dependent If-Then-Else Equals Right if Proposition is True: $(\text{dite } P \, A \, (\lambda h, b)) = b \leftrightarrow (\forall h : P, A(h) = b)$ : For any type $\alpha$, any element $b \in \alpha$, and any decidable proposition $P$, the dependent if-then-else construct `dite P A (fun x => b)` is equal to $b$ if and only if for every proof $h$ of $P$, the function $A$ applied to $h$ is equal to $b$. In other words, if $P$ is true, then $A(h) = b$ for all proofs $h$ of $P$; if $P$ is false, then the result is $b$.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We need to show that the dependent if-then-else construct `dite P A (fun x => b)` is equal to $b$ if and only if for every proof $h$ of $P$, $A(h) = b$.

Consider two cases:

1. **Case 1: Assume $P$ holds.**
- In this case, the dependent if-then-else construct `dite P A (fun x => b)` simplifies to $A(h)$, where $h$ is a proof of $P$.
- We need to show that $A(h) = b$ for any proof $h$ of $P$.
- By the property of universal quantification over true propositions, $\forall h : P, A(h) = b$ is equivalent to $A(h) = b$ for any proof $h$ of $P$.
- Therefore, in this case, `dite P A (fun x => b) = b` if and only if $A(h) = b$ for any proof $h$ of $P$.

2. **Case 2: Assume $P$ does not hold.**
- In this case, the dependent if-then-else construct `dite P A (fun x => b)` simplifies to $b$.
- We need to show that $\forall h : P, A(h) = b$ is true.
- By the property of universal quantification over false propositions, $\forall h : P, A(h) = b$ is equivalent to `True` if $P$ is false.
- Therefore, in this case, `dite P A (fun x => b) = b` is always true.

Combining both cases, we conclude that `dite P A (fun x => b) = b` if and only if for every proof $h$ of $P$, $A(h) = b$. This completes the proof. $\blacksquare$
