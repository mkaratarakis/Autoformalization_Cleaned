1. **Informal Theorem**  
Existence of Element in List for `findSome?` Result : For any types \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \), any element \( b \) of type \( \beta \), any list \( l \) of elements of type \( \alpha \), and any function \( f : \alpha \to \text{Option} \, \beta \), if the result of `List.findSome? f l` is `some b`, then there exists an element \( a \) in \( l \) such that \( f(a) = \text{some} \, b \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We proceed by induction on the list \( l \).

1. **Base Case:**
- Consider the case where the list \( l \) is empty, i.e., \( l = [] \).
- If `findSome? f [] = some b`, this is impossible because `findSome? f []` always returns `none`.
- Therefore, the goal is trivially true.

2. **Inductive Step:**
- Consider the case where the list \( l \) is non-empty, i.e., \( l = h :: l' \).
- We use the induction hypothesis \( ih \), which states that if `findSome? f l' = some b`, then there exists an element \( a \) in \( l' \) such that \( f(a) = \text{some} \, b \).

We need to show that if `findSome? f (h :: l') = some b`, then there exists an element \( a \) in \( h :: l' \) such that \( f(a) = \text{some} \, b \).

- **Case 1:**
- Suppose \( f(h) = \text{some} \, b \).
- Then \( h \) is an element in \( h :: l' \) and \( f(h) = \text{some} \, b \).
- Therefore, the goal is satisfied with \( a = h \).

- **Case 2:**
- Suppose \( f(h) = \text{none} \) and \( \text{findSome?} \, f \, l' = \text{some} \, b \).
- By the induction hypothesis, there exists an element \( a \) in \( l' \) such that \( f(a) = \text{some} \, b \).
- Since \( a \) is in \( l' \), it is also in \( h :: l' \).
- Therefore, the goal is satisfied with \( a \).

In both cases, we have shown that if `findSome? f (h :: l') = some b`, then there exists an element \( a \) in \( h :: l' \) such that \( f(a) = \text{some} \, b \).

Thus, the theorem is proved. \(\blacksquare\)
