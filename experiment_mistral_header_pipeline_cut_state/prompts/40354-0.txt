1. **Informal Theorem**  
Associativity of List Append: \((\text{as} \oplus \text{bs}) \oplus \text{cs} = \text{as} \oplus (\text{bs} \oplus \text{cs})\) : For any type \( \alpha \) and any lists \( \text{as}, \text{bs}, \text{cs} \) of elements of type \( \alpha \), the append operation is associative, i.e., \((\text{as} \oplus \text{bs}) \oplus \text{cs} = \text{as} \oplus (\text{bs} \oplus \text{cs})\), where \( \oplus \) denotes the append operation.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We prove the associativity of the append operation by induction on the list `as`.

1. **Base Case:**
- Consider the case where `as` is the empty list, i.e., `as = nil`.
- The goal is to show that `nil ++ bs ++ cs = nil ++ (bs ++ cs)`.
- Since the empty list `nil` appended to any list is the list itself, both sides of the equation are equal to `bs ++ cs`.
- Therefore, the equality holds trivially due to the reflexive property.

2. **Inductive Case:**
- Consider the case where `as` is a non-empty list, i.e., `as = a :: as'` for some element `a` and list `as'`.
- The goal is to show that `a :: as' ++ bs ++ cs = a :: (as' ++ (bs ++ cs))`.
- By the inductive hypothesis, we know that `as' ++ bs ++ cs = as' ++ (bs ++ cs)`.
- Using this hypothesis, we can simplify the left-hand side of the goal to `a :: (as' ++ bs ++ cs)`, which is equal to `a :: (as' ++ (bs ++ cs))` by the definition of the append operation.
- Therefore, the equality holds.

By induction, the associativity of the append operation is proven for all lists `as`, `bs`, and `cs`. This completes the proof.
