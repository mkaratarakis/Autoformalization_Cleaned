1. **Informal Theorem**  
Membership in Left List Implies Membership in Appended List : For any type \( \alpha \), any element \( a \) of type \( \alpha \), and any lists \( as \) and \( bs \) of elements of type \( \alpha \), if \( a \) is a member of \( as \), then \( a \) is also a member of the list \( as ++ bs \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by letting \( h \) be the hypothesis that \( a \in as \). We need to show that \( a \in as ++ bs \).

1. **Case 1: \( a \) is the head of the list \( as \).**
- By the property that an element is a member of a list if it is the head of the list, \( a \in a :: as \).
- Therefore, \( a \in a :: as ++ bs \).

2. **Case 2: \( a \) is a member of the tail of the list \( as \).**
- By the induction hypothesis, \( a \in as \) implies \( a \in as ++ bs \).
- Since \( a \in as \) and \( as \) is the tail of \( as \), we have \( a \in as ++ bs \).
- By the property that if an element is in a list, it is also in the list obtained by adding an element to the front, \( a \in b :: as ++ bs \).

Thus, in both cases, we have shown that \( a \in as ++ bs \). This completes the proof.
