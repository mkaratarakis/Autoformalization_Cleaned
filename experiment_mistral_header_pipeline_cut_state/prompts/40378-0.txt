1. **Informal Theorem**  
Length of Concatenated List: \(\text{length}(as \cdot a) = \text{length}(as) + 1\) : For any type \(\alpha\) and any list \(as : \text{List}(\alpha)\), and any element \(a : \alpha\), the length of the list obtained by appending \(a\) to the end of \(as\) is equal to the length of \(as\) plus 1. In other words, if \(as\) is a list and \(a\) is an element, then \(\text{length}(as \cdot a) = \text{length}(as) + 1\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We prove this by induction on the list \(as\).

**Base Case:**
Consider the case where \(as\) is the empty list \(\text{nil}\). The length of the list obtained by appending \(a\) to the end of \(\text{nil}\) is:
\[
\text{length}(\text{nil} \cdot a) = \text{length}(\text{cons}(a, \text{nil})) = 1
\]
On the other hand, the length of \(\text{nil}\) is \(0\), and adding 1 to it gives:
\[
\text{length}(\text{nil}) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1
\]
Thus, the equality \(\text{length}(\text{nil} \cdot a) = \text{length}(\text{nil}) + 1\) holds.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume the statement holds for some list \(xs\), i.e., \(\text{length}(xs \cdot a) = \text{length}(xs) + 1\). We need to show that the statement holds for the list \(\text{cons}(x, xs)\) for some element \(x\). The length of the list obtained by appending \(a\) to the end of \(\text{cons}(x, xs)\) is:
\[
\text{length}((\text{cons}(x, xs)) \cdot a) = \text{length}(\text{cons}(x, (xs \cdot a)))
\]
By the definition of `length`, this is:
\[
\text{length}(\text{cons}(x, (xs \cdot a))) = \text{length}(xs \cdot a) + 1
\]
By the inductive hypothesis, we have:
\[
\text{length}(xs \cdot a) = \text{length}(xs) + 1
\]
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
\[
\text{length}(\text{cons}(x, (xs \cdot a))) = (\text{length}(xs) + 1) + 1 = \text{length}(xs) + 2
\]
On the other hand, the length of \(\text{cons}(x, xs)\) is:
\[
\text{length}(\text{cons}(x, xs)) = \text{length}(xs) + 1
\]
Adding 1 to this, we get:
\[
\text{length}(\text{cons}(x, xs)) + 1 = (\text{length}(xs) + 1) + 1 = \text{length}(xs) + 2
\]
Thus, the equality \(\text{length}((\text{cons}(x, xs)) \cdot a) = \text{length}(\text{cons}(x, xs)) + 1\) holds.

By induction, the theorem is proved. \(\blacksquare\)
