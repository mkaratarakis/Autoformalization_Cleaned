1. **Informal Theorem**  
Denotation of Expression to Polynomial Conversion in Natural Numbers : For any context \( \text{ctx} \) of type `Nat.Linear.Context` and any expression \( e \) of type `Nat.SOM.Expr`, the denotation of the polynomial \( e.\text{toPoly} \) in the context \( \text{ctx} \) is equal to the denotation of the expression \( e \) in the same context, i.e., \(\text{denote}(\text{ctx}, e.\text{toPoly}) = \text{denote}(\text{ctx}, e)\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We perform induction on the structure of the expression \( e \).

1. **Case: \( e \) is a multiplication of two expressions \( a \) and \( b \):**
- We use the property that the denotation of the product of two polynomials is the product of their denotations. This simplifies the goal to showing that the denotation of the product of the polynomials \( a \) and \( b \) is equal to the product of the denotations of \( a \) and \( b \). By the induction hypothesis, we know that \(\text{denote}(\text{ctx}, a.\text{toPoly}) = \text{denote}(\text{ctx}, a)\) and \(\text{denote}(\text{ctx}, b.\text{toPoly}) = \text{denote}(\text{ctx}, b)\). Therefore, \(\text{denote}(\text{ctx}, (a \cdot b).\text{toPoly}) = \text{denote}(\text{ctx}, a.\text{toPoly}) \cdot \text{denote}(\text{ctx}, b.\text{toPoly}) = \text{denote}(\text{ctx}, a) \cdot \text{denote}(\text{ctx}, b) = \text{denote}(\text{ctx}, a \cdot b)\).

2. **Case: \( e \) is a natural number \( k \):**
- We need to show that the denotation of the polynomial corresponding to \( k \) is equal to the denotation of the expression \( k \).
- We consider two sub-cases:
- **Sub-case: \( k = 0 \):**
- We simplify the goal to show that the denotation of the polynomial corresponding to zero is zero. This is trivially true.
- **Sub-case: \( k \neq 0 \):**
- We simplify the goal to show that the denotation of the polynomial corresponding to \( k \) is \( k \). This is also trivially true.

3. **Case: \( e \) is a variable \( v \):**
- We simplify the goal to show that the denotation of the polynomial corresponding to \( v \) is equal to the denotation of the expression \( v \). This is trivially true.

4. **Case: \( e \) is the sum of two expressions \( a \) and \( b \):**
- We use the property that the denotation of the sum of two polynomials is the sum of their denotations. This simplifies the goal to showing that the denotation of the sum of the polynomials \( a \) and \( b \) is equal to the sum of the denotations of \( a \) and \( b \). By the induction hypothesis, we know that \(\text{denote}(\text{ctx}, a.\text{toPoly}) = \text{denote}(\text{ctx}, a)\) and \(\text{denote}(\text{ctx}, b.\text{toPoly}) = \text{denote}(\text{ctx}, b)\). Therefore, \(\text{denote}(\text{ctx}, (a + b).\text{toPoly}) = \text{denote}(\text{ctx}, a.\text{toPoly}) + \text{denote}(\text{ctx}, b.\text{toPoly}) = \text{denote}(\text{ctx}, a) + \text{denote}(\text{ctx}, b) = \text{denote}(\text{ctx}, a + b)\).

By considering all cases, we have shown that for any expression \( e \), the denotation of the polynomial \( e.\text{toPoly} \) in the context \( \text{ctx} \) is equal to the denotation of the expression \( e \) in the same context. This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
