1. **Informal Theorem**  
Minimum is Less Than or Equal to Right Argument in Integers : For any integers \(a\) and \(b\), the minimum of \(a\) and \(b\) is less than or equal to \(b\), i.e., \(\min(a, b) \le b\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that \(\min(a, b) \le b\), we start by using the definition of the minimum function in a linear order. According to this definition, \(\min(a, b)\) is given by:
\[
\min(a, b) = \begin{cases}
a & \text{if } a \le b \\
b & \text{if } b \le a
\end{cases}
\]
Thus, the goal of showing \(\min(a, b) \le b\) is equivalent to showing:
\[
(\text{if } a \le b \text{ then } a \text{ else } b) \le b
\]

We consider two cases:

1. **Case 1: \(a \le b\)**

In this case, \(\min(a, b) = a\). Therefore, we need to show that \(a \le b\). This is true by the assumption \(a \le b\).

2. **Case 2: \(b \le a\)**

In this case, \(\min(a, b) = b\). Therefore, we need to show that \(b \le b\). This is trivially true by the reflexive property of the order relation.

In both cases, we have shown that \(\min(a, b) \le b\). Therefore, the theorem is proved. \(\blacksquare\)
