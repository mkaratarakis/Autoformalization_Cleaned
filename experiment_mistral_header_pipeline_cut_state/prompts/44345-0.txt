1. **Informal Theorem**  
Negative Successor of a Natural Number is Not Nonnegative : For any natural number \( n \), the negative successor of \( n \) in the integers, denoted as \( - (n + 1) \), is nonnegative if and only if the false proposition holds, i.e., \( 0 \le - (n + 1) \leftrightarrow \text{False} \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that \( 0 \le - (n + 1) \) is equivalent to the false proposition, we start by noting that \( 0 \le - (n + 1) \) is equivalent to the negation of \( - (n + 1) < 0 \). This is because the statement \( 0 \le - (n + 1) \) is false if and only if \( - (n + 1) < 0 \) is true.

We then use the theorem that states \( - (n + 1) < 0 \) for any natural number \( n \). This theorem is true because the negative of any positive integer is less than zero. Therefore, \( - (n + 1) < 0 \) is always true for any natural number \( n \).

Since \( - (n + 1) < 0 \) is always true, the negation of this statement, \( 0 \le - (n + 1) \), is always false. Hence, \( 0 \le - (n + 1) \) is equivalent to the false proposition. This completes the proof.
