1. **Informal Theorem**  
Negation of Nonpositive Integer is Nonnegative : For any integer \( a \), if \( a \leq 0 \), then \( 0 \leq -a \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by assuming that \( a \leq 0 \). We need to show that \( 0 \leq -a \).

First, we construct the lemma that \(-0 \leq -a\) by using the fact that if \(a \leq 0\), then \(-0 \leq -a\). This follows from the property that the negation of an inequality in an ordered additive commutative group reverses the inequality.

Next, we use the property that the negation of zero is zero, i.e., \(-0 = 0\), to replace \(-0\) with \(0\) in the lemma \(-0 \leq -a\). This simplifies our lemma to \(0 \leq -a\), which is exactly what we need to prove.

Therefore, we have shown that if \(a \leq 0\), then \(0 \leq -a\). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
