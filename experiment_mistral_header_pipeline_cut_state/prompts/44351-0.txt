1. **Informal Theorem**  
Nonnegative Integer Equals Canonical Image of Natural Number: \( 0 \leq a \to \exists n, a = n \) : For any integer \( a \) such that \( 0 \leq a \), there exists a natural number \( n \) such that \( a = n \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
Given an integer \( a \) such that \( 0 \leq a \), we need to show that there exists a natural number \( n \) such that \( a = n \).

1. **Step 1:**
Since \( 0 \leq a \), by the lemma that nonnegativity implies the existence of a nonnegative difference, there exists an integer \( c \) such that \( a = 0 + c \). Simplifying this, we get \( a = c \).

2. **Step 2:**
Since \( a = c \) and \( 0 \leq a \), it follows that \( c \) is a nonnegative integer. Therefore, \( c \) can be viewed as a natural number. Let \( n = c \). Thus, \( a = n \).

Hence, we have shown that there exists a natural number \( n \) such that \( a = n \). This completes the proof.
