1. **Informal Theorem**  
Positive Difference Implies Less Than in Integers : For any integers \(a\) and \(b\), if \(b < a\), then \(0 < a - b\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that \(0 < a - b\) given \(b < a\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Step 1:**
We use the property that adding the same element to both sides of a strict inequality preserves the inequality. Specifically, since \( b < a \), adding \(-b\) to both sides gives:
\[
b + (-b) < a + (-b)
\]
We denote this new inequality as \( h \).

2. **Step 2:**
We use the property of additive inverses, which states that for any integer \( b \), \( b + (-b) = 0 \). Applying this property to the inequality \( b + (-b) < a + (-b) \), we get:
\[
0 < a + (-b)
\]
This is equivalent to:
\[
0 < a - b
\]
which is exactly what we need to prove.

Therefore, we have shown that if \( b < a \), then \( 0 < a - b \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
