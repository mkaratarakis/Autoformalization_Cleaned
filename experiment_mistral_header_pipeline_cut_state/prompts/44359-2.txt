Below are the error message and proof state for the proof you generated. Please revise the proof accordingly starting with new prefix. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
6. **Error Message and Proof State**
tmp.lean:10:2: error: type mismatch
  Int.mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left h₁ h₂
has type
  c * a ≤ c * b : Prop
but is expected to have type
  a * c ≤ b * c : Prop
tmp.lean:9:49: error: unsolved goals
a b c : Int
h₁ : a ≤ b
h₂ : 0 ≤ c
⊢ a * c ≤ b * c
a b c : Int
h₁ : a ≤ b
h₂ : 0 ≤ c
⊢ a * c ≤ b * c

4. **New Prefix**
