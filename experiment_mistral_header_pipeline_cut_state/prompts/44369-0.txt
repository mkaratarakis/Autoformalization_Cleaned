1. **Informal Theorem**  
Absolute Value of Negation of a Natural Number as an Integer Equals the Natural Number : For any natural number \( n \), the absolute value of the negation of \( n \) as an integer, denoted as \(\text{natAbs}(-n)\), is equal to \( n \). In other words, \(\text{natAbs}(\text{Int.negOfNat}(n)) = n\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We will consider every possible case of \( n \).

**Case 1: \( n = 0 \)**
The goal is to show that \((\text{negOfNat}(0)).\text{natAbs} = 0\). This is trivially true because the negation of \(0\) as an integer is \(-0\), and the absolute value of \(-0\) is \(0\).

**Case 2: \( n = k + 1 \) for some \( k \in \mathbb{N} \)**
The goal is to show that \((\text{negOfNat}(k + 1)).\text{natAbs} = k + 1\). This is also trivially true because the negation of \(k + 1\) as an integer is \(-(k + 1)\), and the absolute value of \(-(k + 1)\) is \(k + 1\).

Since both cases are trivially true, the theorem holds for all natural numbers \( n \). This completes the proof.
