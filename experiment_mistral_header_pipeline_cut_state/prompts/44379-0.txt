1. **Informal Theorem**  
Integer is Less Than or Equal to its Canonical Image in Natural Numbers: \( a \leq \text{toNat}(a) \) : For any integer \( a \), it holds that \( a \leq \text{toNat}(a) \), where \(\text{toNat}(a)\) is the canonical map from integers to natural numbers. Specifically, if \( a \) is non-negative, \(\text{toNat}(a) = a\), and if \( a \) is negative, \(\text{toNat}(a) = 0\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that for any integer \( a \), \( a \leq \text{toNat}(a) \), we start by using the property of the canonical map from integers to natural numbers. Specifically, we know that \( a.\text{toNat} = \max(a, 0) \). This means that the canonical map \( a.\text{toNat} \) is the maximum of \( a \) and \( 0 \).

Thus, the goal \( a \leq a.\text{toNat} \) is equivalent to \( a \leq \max(a, 0) \).

- If \( a \geq 0 \), then \( \max(a, 0) = a \). Therefore, \( a \leq a \) is trivially true.
- If \( a < 0 \), then \( \max(a, 0) = 0 \). Therefore, \( a \leq 0 \) is also true since \( a \) is negative.

In both cases, \( a \leq \max(a, 0) \) holds. Hence, \( a \leq \text{toNat}(a) \) for any integer \( a \).

This completes the proof.
