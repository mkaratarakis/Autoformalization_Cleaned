1. **Informal Theorem**  
Left Addition by Positive Integer Preserves Strict Inequality in Integers : For any integers \(a\) and \(b\), if \(0 < b\), then \(a < b + a\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove that \(a < b + a\) given \(0 < b\), we start by using the property that adding the same element to both sides of a strict inequality preserves the inequality. Specifically, since \(0 < b\) (by assumption), we have:
\[
0 + a < b + a
\]
Next, we use the property that adding zero to any integer \(a\) results in \(a\) itself, i.e., \(0 + a = a\). Substituting \(0 + a\) with \(a\) in the inequality \(0 + a < b + a\), we get:
\[
a < b + a
\]
This is exactly the goal we need to prove. Therefore, the theorem is established. \(\blacksquare\)
