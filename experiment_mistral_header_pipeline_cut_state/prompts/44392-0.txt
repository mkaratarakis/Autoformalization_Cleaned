1. **Informal Theorem**  
Subtraction Less Than Zero Implies Less Than in Integers : For any integers \(a\) and \(b\), if \(a - b < 0\), then \(a < b\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the theorem, we start with the given inequality \(a - b < 0\). We construct a new hypothesis by adding \(b\) to both sides of this inequality:
\[
a - b + b < 0 + b
\]
Using the property of subtraction and addition, we know that \(a - b + b = a\). Additionally, using the property of the zero element, we know that \(0 + b = b\). Therefore, the inequality simplifies to:
\[
a < b
\]
This is exactly the goal we need to prove. Hence, we have shown that if \(a - b < 0\), then \(a < b\). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
