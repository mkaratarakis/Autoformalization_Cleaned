Below are the error message and proof state for the proof you generated. Please revise the proof accordingly starting with new prefix. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
6. **Error Message and Proof State**
tmp.lean:13:37: error: application type mismatch
  le_add_right h
argument
  h
has type
  a + b ≤ c : Prop
but is expected to have type
  Nat : Type
tmp.lean:11:26: error: unsolved goals
a b c : Int
h : a + b ≤ c
⊢ b = b + (a + -a)
tmp.lean:12:29: error: simp made no progress
tmp.lean:14:0: error: unexpected end of input; expected ':='
tmp.lean:13:4: error: unknown identifier 'trace_state'

4. **New Prefix**
