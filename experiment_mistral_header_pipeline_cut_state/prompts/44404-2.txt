Below are the error message and proof state for the proof you generated. Please revise the proof accordingly starting with new prefix. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
6. **Error Message and Proof State**
tmp.lean:9:31: error: type mismatch, term
  h
after simplification has type
  -b + a ≤ c : Prop
but is expected to have type
  a + -b ≤ c : Prop
tmp.lean:10:8: error: unknown identifier 'le_add_of_le_sub'
tmp.lean:8:54: error: unsolved goals
a b c : Int
h : -b + a ≤ c
⊢ a ≤ b + c
a b c : Int
h : -b + a ≤ c
⊢ a ≤ b + c

4. **New Prefix**  
   The initial Lean 4 code that you must build on.
