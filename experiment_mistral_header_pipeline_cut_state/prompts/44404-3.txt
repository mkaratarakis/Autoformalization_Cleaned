Below are the error message and proof state for the proof you generated. Please revise the proof accordingly starting with new prefix. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
6. **Error Message and Proof State**
tmp.lean:9:34: error: unknown identifier 'add_comm'
tmp.lean:10:2: error: type mismatch
  Int.add_le_add_left h1 b
has type
  b + (a + -b) ≤ b + c : Prop
but is expected to have type
  a ≤ b + c : Prop
tmp.lean:8:54: error: unsolved goals
a b c : Int
h : -b + a ≤ c
⊢ a ≤ b + c
a b c : Int
h : -b + a ≤ c
⊢ a ≤ b + c
