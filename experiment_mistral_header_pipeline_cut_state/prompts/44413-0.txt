1. **Informal Theorem**  
Negative Successor of a Natural Number is Not Positive: \( 0 < - (n + 1) \leftrightarrow \text{False} \) : For any natural number \( n \), the negative successor of \( n \) in the integers, denoted as \( - (n + 1) \), is not positive, i.e., \( 0 < - (n + 1) \) is false.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We need to show that for any natural number \( n \), the statement \( 0 < - (n + 1) \) is false.

First, we use the theorems that the negation of \( a < b \) is \( b \le a \) and the equivalence of negations to simplify the goal. This simplifies the goal to showing that \( 0 < - (n + 1) \) implies \(\text{False}\).

To prove this implication, we assume \( 0 < - (n + 1) \) and show that this leads to a contradiction.

Assume \( 0 < - (n + 1) \). By the definition of the negative successor, \( - (n + 1) \) is a negative integer. Therefore, \( - (n + 1) \le 0 \). This contradicts our assumption that \( 0 < - (n + 1) \), because \( 0 < - (n + 1) \) implies \( - (n + 1) > 0 \), which is impossible.

Thus, the assumption \( 0 < - (n + 1) \) leads to a contradiction, and therefore \( 0 < - (n + 1) \) is false. This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
