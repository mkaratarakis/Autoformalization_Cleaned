Below are the error message and proof state for the proof you generated. Please revise the proof accordingly starting with new prefix. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
6. **Error Message and Proof State**
tmp.lean:10:4: error: type mismatch
  Int.add_lt_add_left h ?m.187
has type
  ?m.187 + a < ?m.187 + (b + c) : Prop
but is expected to have type
  a + -b < b + c + -b : Prop
tmp.lean:12:8: error: unknown identifier 'add_comm'
tmp.lean:13:2: error: type mismatch
  Int.add_lt_add_left h ?m.2714
has type
  ?m.2714 + a < ?m.2714 + (b + c) : Prop
but is expected to have type
  a - b < c : Prop
tmp.lean:10:2: error: expected '{' or indented tactic sequence
tmp.lean:9:37: error: unsolved goals
a b c : Int
h : a < b + c
⊢ a + -b < b + c + -b
tmp.lean:8:53: error: unsolved goals
a b c : Int
h : a < b + c
h1 : a + -b < b + c + -b
⊢ a - b < c

4. **New Prefix**  
   The initial Lean 4 code that you must build on.

open Int
open Nat

example {a b c : Int} (h : a < b + c) : a - b < c := by
  have h1 : a + -b < (b + c) + -b := by
