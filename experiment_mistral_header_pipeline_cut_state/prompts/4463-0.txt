1. **Informal Theorem**  
Minimum of Replicated List is the Element if Positive Replication : For any type $\alpha$ with a minimum operation, and for any natural number $n$ and element $a \in \alpha$, if the minimum of $a$ and $a$ is $a$ (i.e., $\min(a, a) = a$) and $n$ is positive (i.e., $0 < n$), then the minimum element of the list containing $n$ copies of $a$ is $a$. Formally, this can be written as:
\[
\min(a, a) = a \quad \text{and} \quad 0 < n \quad \implies \quad (\text{replicate } n \, a).minimum? = \text{some } a
\]

2. **Informal Proof**  
Given that \(\min(a, a) = a\) and \(0 < n\), we use the property of the minimum operation on a replicated list, which states that the minimum element of the list `replicate n a` is:
- `none` if \( n = 0 \),
- `some a` if \( n > 0 \).

Since \(0 < n\), it follows that \( n \neq 0 \). Therefore, by the definition of the minimum operation on a replicated list and the given conditions, we conclude that the minimum element of the list `replicate n a` is `some a`. This completes the proof.

    (replicate n a).minimum? = some a := by sorry
