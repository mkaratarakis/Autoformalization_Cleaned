1. **Informal Theorem**  
Removal of Predicate-Satisfying Element from Filtered List : For any type \( \alpha \), a predicate \( p \) on \( \alpha \), and a predicate \( f \) on \( \alpha \), the result of removing the first element satisfying \( p \) from the list filtered by \( f \) is the same as filtering the list by \( f \) and then removing the first element that satisfies both \( p \) and \( f \). Formally, for any list \( l \) of elements of \( \alpha \),
\[
\text{eraseP } p (\text{filter } f \, l) = \text{filter } f (\text{eraseP } (p \land f) \, l).
\]

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start by using the equivalence that the `filterMap` operation with `Option.guard` is the same as the `filter` operation. This allows us to rewrite the goal as:
\[
\text{filterMap } (Option.guard \, f) \, (\text{eraseP } (fun x => p x \land f x) \, l) = \text{filterMap } (Option.guard \, f) \, (\text{eraseP } (fun x => p x \land f x) \, l).
\]
It suffices to show this new goal.

Next, we decompose the equality to prove that the function applied to the list on both sides of the equation is the same. This reduces our goal to showing:
\[
(fun x => p x \land f x) = (fun x => p x \land f x).
\]

To prove this, we introduce a new variable \( x \) into the context to reason about the expression, allowing us to consider cases or instances involving \( x \). This reduces our goal to showing:
\[
\text{match } (if f x = \text{true} \, \text{then } some \, x \, \text{else } none) \, \text{with} \\
\text{| some } y \, \text{=> } p y \\
\text{| none } \, \text{=> } \text{false} \\
\text{end} = (p x \land f x).
\]

Using the definition of `Option.guard`, we can simplify the expression to:
\[
\text{match } (if f x = \text{true} \, \text{then } some \, x \, \text{else } none) \, \text{with} \\
\text{| some } y \, \text{=> } p y \\
\text{| none } \, \text{=> } \text{false} \\
\text{end} = (p x \land f x).
\]

We now discuss by cases based on the condition \( f x = \text{true} \):
- If \( f x = \text{true} \), then the expression simplifies to:
\[
p y = (p x \land f x)
\]
where \( y = x \). Since \( y = x \), this reduces to:
\[
p x = (p x \land f x)
\]
which is true because \( f x = \text{true} \).
- If \( f x = \text{false} \), then the expression simplifies to:
\[
\text{false} = (p x \land f x)
\]
which is true because \( f x = \text{false} \).

Thus, the original goal is established, and the proof is complete.
