6. **Error Message and Proof State**
tmp.lean:12:27: error: type mismatch
  head
has type
  (as : List ?m.193) → as ≠ [] → ?m.193 : Type ?u.192
but is expected to have type
  α : Type u_1
tmp.lean:12:4: error: tactic 'cases' failed, major premise type is not an inductive type
  ?m.658

Explanation: the 'cases' tactic is for constructor-based reasoning as well as for applying custom cases principles with a 'using' clause or a registered '@[cases_eliminator]' theorem. The above type neither is an inductive type nor has a registered theorem.
