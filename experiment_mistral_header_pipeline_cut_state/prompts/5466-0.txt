1. **Informal Theorem**  
Equality of True is the Identity Function: \( \text{Eq}(\text{True}) = \text{id} \) : The equality relation on the proposition `True` is the same as the identity function, i.e., \( \text{Eq}(\text{True}) = \text{id} \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We aim to show that the equality relation on the proposition `True` is the same as the identity function. To do this, we apply function extensionality to consider an arbitrary element. Then, we simplify using the fact that `True` is always true, the definition of the identity function, and the equivalence of equality and implication. This simplification directly shows that the equality relation on `True` is indeed the identity function.
