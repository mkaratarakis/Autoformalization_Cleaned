Below are the error message and proof state for the proof you generated. Please revise the proof accordingly starting with new prefix. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
6. **Error Message and Proof State**
tmp.lean:16:30: error: application type mismatch
  Or.inr h
argument
  h
has type
  c : Prop
but is expected to have type
  c ∨ a : Prop
tmp.lean:20:6: error: tactic 'cases' failed, major premise type is not an inductive type
  b

Explanation: the 'cases' tactic is for constructor-based reasoning as well as for applying custom cases principles with a 'using' clause or a registered '@[cases_eliminator]' theorem. The above type neither is an inductive type nor has a registered theorem.
case mpr.inl
a b c : Prop
h : b
⊢ a ∨ b ∨ c
tmp.lean:23:28: error: application type mismatch
  Or.inl (Or.inr h)
argument
  Or.inr h
has type
  ?m.332 ∨ c ∨ a : Prop
but is expected to have type
  a : Prop
tmp.lean:15:6: error: alternative 'inr' has not been provided
tmp.lean:8:35: error: unsolved goals
case mpr
a b c : Prop
⊢ b ∨ c ∨ a → a ∨ b ∨ c
