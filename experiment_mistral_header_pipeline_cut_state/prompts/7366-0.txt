1. **Informal Theorem**  
Length of Take Equals \( n \) if \( n \leq \text{length}(l) \) : For any natural number \( n \) and any list \( l \) of elements of type \( \alpha \), if \( n \) is less than or equal to the length of \( l \), then the length of the list obtained by taking the first \( n \) elements of \( l \) is equal to \( n \). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[
n \leq \text{length}(l) \implies \text{length}(\text{take}(n, l)) = n
\]

2. **Informal Proof**  
Given a natural number \( n \) and a list \( l \) of elements of type \( \alpha \), assume that \( n \leq \text{length}(l) \). We need to show that the length of the list obtained by taking the first \( n \) elements of \( l \) is equal to \( n \).

By the definition of the `take` function, \(\text{take}(n, l)\) returns the first \( n \) elements of \( l \). The length of this resulting list is given by \(\text{length}(\text{take}(n, l))\).

Using the property of the minimum function, we know that for any two natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\), if \(a \leq b\), then \(\min(a, b) = a\). Given our assumption \(n \leq \text{length}(l)\), we have:
\[
\min(n, \text{length}(l)) = n
\]

The length of the list obtained by taking the first \( n \) elements of \( l \) is defined as \(\min(n, \text{length}(l))\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\text{length}(\text{take}(n, l)) = \min(n, \text{length}(l)) = n
\]

Thus, the length of the list obtained by taking the first \( n \) elements of \( l \) is indeed \( n \). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
