1. **Informal Theorem**  
Element at Index in Take Equals Element at Index in Original List: \(\text{get}(\text{take}(j, L), i) = \text{get}(L, i)\) : For any list \( L \) of elements of type \( \alpha \) and any natural numbers \( j \) and \( i \) such that \( i \) is a valid index in the list obtained by taking the first \( j \) elements of \( L \), the \( i \)-th element of the list `List.take j L` is equal to the \( i \)-th element of the original list \( L \). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[
\text{get}(\text{take}(j, L), i) = \text{get}(L, i)
\]
where \( i \) is a natural number less than the length of `List.take j L`.

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the theorem, we start with the given list \( L \) and natural numbers \( j \) and \( i \) such that \( i \) is a valid index in the list obtained by taking the first \( j \) elements of \( L \). We need to show that:
\[
\text{get}(\text{take}(j, L), i) = \text{get}(L, i)
\]

We use the theorem that states the \( i \)-th element of a list obtained by taking the first \( j \) elements of \( L \) is equal to the \( i \)-th element of the original list \( L \). Formally, this theorem can be written as:
\[
\text{take}(j, L)[i] = L[i]
\]

By applying this theorem, we can directly simplify the proposition we want to show:
\[
\text{get}(\text{take}(j, L), i) = L[i]
\]

Since the \( i \)-th element of the list `List.take j L` is indeed equal to the \( i \)-th element of the original list \( L \), the goal is proven. Therefore, we have:
\[
\text{get}(\text{take}(j, L), i) = \text{get}(L, i)
\]

This completes the proof.
