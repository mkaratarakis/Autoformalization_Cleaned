1. **Informal Theorem**  
First Element of Dropped List Equals \( n \)-th Element of Original List (Optional Version) : For any list \( l \) of elements of type \( \alpha \) and any natural number \( n \), the first element of the list obtained by dropping the first \( n \) elements of \( l \) is equal to the \( n \)-th element of \( l \), when both are considered as optional values. Formally, this is expressed as:
\[
\text{For any list } l \text{ of type } \alpha \text{ and natural number } n, \text{ we have } (\text{List.drop } n \, l).\text{head?} = l[n]?
\]

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the theorem, we start with the goal of showing that the first element of the list obtained by dropping the first \( n \) elements of \( l \) is equal to the \( n \)-th element of \( l \) as optional values. Formally, we need to show:
\[
(\text{List.drop } n \, l).\text{head?} = l[n]?
\]

1. **Step 1:**
We use the fact that the optional head of a list is equal to the optional element at index 0. This transforms our goal to:
\[
(\text{List.drop } n \, l)[0]? = l[n]?
\]

2. **Step 2:**
Next, we use the property that the optional element at index \( j \) in the list obtained by dropping the first \( i \) elements is equal to the optional element at index \( i + j \) in the original list. This transforms our goal to:
\[
l[n + 0]? = l[n]?
\]

3. **Step 3:**
Finally, we use the property that adding zero to any natural number \( n \) results in \( n \). This simplifies our goal to:
\[
l[n]? = l[n]?
\]
which is trivially true.

Thus, we have shown that:
\[
(\text{List.drop } n \, l).\text{head?} = l[n]?
\]
This completes the proof.
