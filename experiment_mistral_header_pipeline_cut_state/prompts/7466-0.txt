1. **Informal Theorem**  
Right Rotation of a Replicated List is the List Itself : For any type $\alpha$, natural numbers $m$ and $n$, and element $a \in \alpha$, the right rotation of a list containing $m$ copies of $a$ by $n$ positions is equal to the original list, i.e., $(\text{replicate } m \, a). \text{rotateRight } n = \text{replicate } m \, a$.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We proceed by induction on \( n \).

**Base Case:**
For \( n = 0 \), we need to show that \((\text{replicate } m \, a). \text{rotateRight } 0 = \text{replicate } m \, a\). By the definition of right rotation, rotating a list by 0 positions results in the same list. Therefore, the base case holds.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume the statement holds for \( n = k \), i.e., \((\text{replicate } m \, a). \text{rotateRight } k = \text{replicate } m \, a\). We need to show that \((\text{replicate } m \, a). \text{rotateRight } (k + 1) = \text{replicate } m \, a\).

To prove this, it suffices to show that if \( 1 < m \), then:
\[
m - (m - (k + 1) \% m) + \min(m - (k + 1) \% m, m) = m
\]

First, we note that \((k + 1) \% m < m\) because \( m > 0 \) (from the assumption \( 1 < m \)). This is a direct consequence of the property of the modulo operation in natural numbers, which states that the remainder of any natural number divided by a positive natural number is less than the divisor.

Next, we use the fact that \(\min(m - (k + 1) \% m, m) = m - (k + 1) \% m\) because \( m - (k + 1) \% m \) is less than or equal to \( m \).

Thus, we need to show:
\[
m - (m - (k + 1) \% m) + (m - (k + 1) \% m) = m
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
\[
m - (m - (k + 1) \% m) + (m - (k + 1) \% m) = m
\]

This is a straightforward equality, and thus the inductive step holds.

By induction, the theorem is proved. \(\blacksquare\)
