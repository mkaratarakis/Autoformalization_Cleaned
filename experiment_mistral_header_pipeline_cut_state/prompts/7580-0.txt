1. **Informal Theorem**  
Concatenation of First \( m \) and First \( n \) Elements of a List After Dropping \( m \) Elements : For any list \( l \) of elements of type \( \alpha \) and any natural numbers \( m \) and \( n \), the first \( m + n \) elements of \( l \) are equal to the concatenation of the first \( m \) elements of \( l \) and the first \( n \) elements of the list obtained by dropping the first \( m \) elements of \( l \). In other words, \( \text{take}(m + n, l) = \text{take}(m, l) \, \text{++} \, \text{take}(n, \text{drop}(m, l)) \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the theorem, we start by noting that the first \( m + n \) elements of \( l \) can be expressed as the first \( m + n \) elements of the concatenation of the first \( m \) elements of \( l \) and the list obtained by dropping the first \( m \) elements of \( l \). This is because the concatenation of the first \( m \) elements of a list and the list obtained by dropping the first \( m \) elements is equal to the original list. Formally, we have:
\[
\text{take}(m + n, l) = \text{take}(m + n, \text{take}(m, l) \oplus \text{drop}(m, l))
\]

Next, we use the property that the first \( n \) elements of the concatenation of two lists are equal to the concatenation of the first \( n \) elements of the first list and the first \( n - \text{length}(\text{take}(m, l)) \) elements of the second list. This gives us:
\[
\text{take}(m + n, \text{take}(m, l) \oplus \text{drop}(m, l)) = \text{take}(m, l) \oplus \text{take}(m + n - \text{length}(\text{take}(m, l)), \text{drop}(m, l))
\]

We also use the property that taking the first \( i \) elements of a list is equal to the list itself if the length of the list is less than or equal to \( i \). Since the length of the first \( m \) elements of \( l \) is less than or equal to \( m \), we have:
\[
\text{take}(m, l) = \text{take}(m, l)
\]

Thus, the goal reduces to showing:
\[
\text{take}(m + n - \text{length}(\text{take}(m, l)), \text{drop}(m, l)) = \text{take}(n, \text{drop}(m, l))
\]

Using the property that the right append operation is injective, we can simplify this to:
\[
\min(m + n - \min(m, \text{length}(l)), \text{length}(l) - m) = \min(n, \text{length}(l) - m)
\]

This is a straightforward arithmetic property of natural numbers, and it holds by the properties of the minimum function and the arithmetic of natural numbers.

Finally, we need to show that the length of the first \( m \) elements of \( l \) is less than or equal to \( m + n \). This is true because the length of the first \( m \) elements of \( l \) is less than or equal to \( m \) (by the property of the length of the first \( m \) elements of a list), and \( m \) is less than or equal to \( m + n \) (by the property of addition of natural numbers).

Thus, we have shown that:
\[
\text{take}(m + n, l) = \text{take}(m, l) \oplus \text{take}(n, \text{drop}(m, l))
\]

This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
