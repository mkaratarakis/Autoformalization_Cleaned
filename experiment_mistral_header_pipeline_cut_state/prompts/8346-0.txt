1. **Informal Theorem**  
Boolean Not-Equal Equivalence in Natural Numbers: \(a \neq b \leftrightarrow c \neq d\) if \(a = b \leftrightarrow c = d\) : For any natural numbers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\), if the equality \(a = b\) is equivalent to the equality \(c = d\), then the boolean not-equal relation \(a \neq b\) is equivalent to the boolean not-equal relation \(c \neq d\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start with the given assumption that the equality \(a = b\) is equivalent to the equality \(c = d\). This means that \(a = b\) if and only if \(c = d\).

To prove that the boolean not-equal relation \(a \neq b\) is equivalent to the boolean not-equal relation \(c \neq d\), we use the definition of the boolean not-equal function `bne`. The function `bne` returns `true` if the two inputs are not equal and `false` otherwise. Formally, \(a \neq b\) is defined as the negation of \(a == b\), and similarly, \(c \neq d\) is defined as the negation of \(c == d\).

Given the theorem that if \(a = b\) is equivalent to \(c = d\), then \(a == b\) is equivalent to \(c == d\), we can use this to simplify our goal. Since \(a == b\) is equivalent to \(c == d\), the negation of \(a == b\) (which is \(a \neq b\)) must be equivalent to the negation of \(c == d\) (which is \(c \neq d\)).

Therefore, we have shown that \((a \neq b) = (c \neq d)\). This completes the proof.
