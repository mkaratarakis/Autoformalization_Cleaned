1. **Informal Theorem**  
Boolean Equality Preservation: \(a = b \leftrightarrow c = d \implies a == b \leftrightarrow c == d\) : For any natural numbers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\), if the equality \(a = b\) is equivalent to the equality \(c = d\), then the boolean equality \(a == b\) is equivalent to the boolean equality \(c == d\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start with the given hypothesis that the equality \(a = b\) is equivalent to the equality \(c = d\), i.e., \((a = b) = (c = d)\). We need to show that the boolean equality \(a == b\) is equivalent to the boolean equality \(c == d\), i.e., \((a == b) = (c == d)\).

Using the fact that the boolean equality \(a == b\) is equivalent to the boolean value obtained by deciding the proposition \(a = b\) (i.e., \(a == b = \text{decide}(a = b)\)), we can rewrite the goal as \(\text{decide}(a = b) = \text{decide}(c = d)\).

Given the hypothesis \((a = b) = (c = d)\), it follows that \(\text{decide}(a = b) = \text{decide}(c = d)\) because the decision function \(\text{decide}\) is a function that maps equal propositions to equal boolean values. Therefore, \((a == b) = (c == d)\) holds true.

This completes the proof.
