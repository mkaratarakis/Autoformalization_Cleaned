1. **Informal Theorem**  
Addition and Subtraction Identity: \(a + b = c + d \leftrightarrow a + (b - d) = c\) for \(b \geq d\) : For any natural numbers \(a\), \(c\), \(b\), and \(d\), if \(b \geq d\), then the equation \(a + b = c + d\) holds if and only if \(a + (b - d) = c\).

2. **Informal Proof**  
We start with the goal of proving that \(a + b = c + d\) if and only if \(a + (b - d) = c\) under the condition that \(b \geq d\).

1. **Symmetry of Equality:**
We use the symmetry of equality to rewrite the goal from \(a + b = c + d\) to \(c + d = a + b\).

2. **Application of Theorem:**
We apply the theorem that states for any natural numbers \(a\), \(c\), \(b\), and \(d\), if \(b \geq d\), then \(a + b = c + d\) is equivalent to \(a + (b - d) = c\). This theorem is valid because it leverages the properties of natural numbers and the definition of subtraction.

3. **Symmetry of Equality:**
We use the symmetry of equality again to rewrite the goal from \(c = a + (b - d)\) to \(a + (b - d) = c\).

Since the goal is now trivially true, the proof is complete. Therefore, we have shown that \(a + b = c + d\) if and only if \(a + (b - d) = c\) for \(b \geq d\).
