Below are the error message and proof state for the proof you generated. Please revise the proof accordingly starting with new prefix. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
6. **Error Message and Proof State**
tmp.lean:14:2: error: 'calc' expression has type
  a + b = c + d : Prop
but is expected to have type
  (a + b = c + d) = (a + (b - d) = c) : Prop
tmp.lean:10:85: error: unsolved goals
a c b d : Nat
h : b ≥ d
h' : b - d + d = b
⊢ (a + b = c + d) = (a + (b - d) = c)

4. **New Prefix**  
   The initial Lean 4 code that you must build on.
import Init.Data.Bool
import Init.Data.Nat.Basic
import Init.Data.Nat.Lemmas
import Init.Data.Nat.Simproc

open Nat
open Simproc


example (a c : Nat) {b d : Nat} (h : b ≥ d) : (a + b = c + d) = (a + (b - d) = c) := by
  have h' : b - d + d = b := by
    apply Nat.sub_add_cancel
    exact h
