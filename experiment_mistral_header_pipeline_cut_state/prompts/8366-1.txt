Below are the error message and proof state for the proof you generated. Please revise the proof accordingly starting with new prefix. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
6. **Error Message and Proof State**
tmp.lean:12:4: error: simp made no progress
tmp.lean:13:6: error: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression
  a + b - d
a c b d : Nat
h : b ≥ d
this : a + b - d = a + (b - d)
⊢ (a + b ≤ c + d) = (a + (b - d) ≤ c)
tmp.lean:12:2: error: expected '{' or indented tactic sequence
tmp.lean:11:36: error: unsolved goals
a c b d : Nat
h : b ≥ d
⊢ a + b - d = a + (b - d)
tmp.lean:10:85: error: unsolved goals
a c b d : Nat
h : b ≥ d
this : a + b - d = a + (b - d)
⊢ (a + b ≤ c + d) = (a + (b - d) ≤ c)

4. **New Prefix**  
   The initial Lean 4 code that you must build on.

example (a c : Nat) {b d : Nat} (h : b ≥ d) : (a + b ≤ c + d) = (a + (b - d) ≤ c) := by
  have : a + b - d = a + (b - d) := by
