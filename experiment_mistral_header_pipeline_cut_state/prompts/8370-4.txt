Below are the error message and proof state for the proof you generated. Please revise the proof accordingly starting with new prefix. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
6. **Error Message and Proof State**
tmp.lean:11:39: error: application type mismatch
  Nat.le_trans h (le_add_left c d)
argument
  le_add_left c d
has type
  c ≤ d + c : Prop
but is expected to have type
  d ≤ c + d : Prop
tmp.lean:16:29: error: type mismatch
  rfl
has type
  ?m.723 = ?m.723 : Prop
but is expected to have type
  (a = c + d - b) = (a = c + (d - b)) : Prop
tmp.lean:10:85: error: unsolved goals
a c b d : Nat
h : b ≤ d
⊢ (a + b = c + d) = (a = c + (d - b))
a c b d : Nat
h : b ≤ d
⊢ (a + b = c + d) = (a = c + (d - b))
