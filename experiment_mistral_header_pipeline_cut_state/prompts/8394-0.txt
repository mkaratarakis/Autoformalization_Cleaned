1. **Informal Theorem**  
Addition and Subtraction with Inequality in Natural Numbers: \(a + b - (c + d) = a - (c + (d - b))\) : For any natural numbers \(a\), \(c\), \(b\), and \(d\) such that \(b \leq d\), the equation \(a + b - (c + d) = a - (c + (d - b))\) holds.

2. **Informal Proof**  
We prove the theorem by induction on \(b\).

1. **Base Case: \(b = 0\)**

When \(b = 0\), the goal is to show that \(a + 0 - (c + d) = a - (c + (d - 0))\). Simplifying, we get:
\[
a - (c + d) = a - (c + d)
\]
which is trivially true.

2. **Inductive Step: \(b = b' + 1\)**

Assume the statement holds for \(b = b'\), i.e., \(a + b' - (c + d) = a - (c + (d - b'))\). We need to show that \(a + (b' + 1) - (c + d) = a - (c + (d - (b' + 1)))\).

- **Case 1: \(d = 0\)**

The goal is to show that \(a + (b' + 1) - (c + 0) = a - (c + (0 - (b' + 1)))\). This simplifies to:
\[
a + (b' + 1) - c = a - (c - (b' + 1))
\]
Since \(b' + 1 \leq 0\) is a contradiction (as \(b' + 1\) is a positive natural number), this case is vacuously true.

- **Case 2: \(d = d' + 1\)**

The goal is to show that \(a + (b' + 1) - (c + (d' + 1)) = a - (c + ((d' + 1) - (b' + 1)))\). Using the properties of natural numbers, we rewrite the goal:
\[
a + (b' + 1) - (c + (d' + 1)) = a - (c + (d' - b'))
\]
By the inductive hypothesis, we know that \(a + b' - (c + d') = a - (c + (d' - b'))\). Therefore, the goal simplifies to:
\[
a + (b' + 1) - (c + (d' + 1)) = a + b' - (c + d')
\]
which is true by the inductive hypothesis.

Thus, by induction, the theorem holds for all natural numbers \(a\), \(c\), \(b\), and \(d\) such that \(b \leq d\). This completes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)
