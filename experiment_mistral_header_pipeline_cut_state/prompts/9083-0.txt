1. **Informal Theorem**  
Sublist Equals to Map of Get with Strictly Increasing Indices : For any lists \( l' \) and \( l \) of elements of type \( \alpha \), if \( l' \) is a sublist of \( l \), then there exists a sequence of indices \( is \) such that \( l' \) is equal to the list obtained by applying the function `l.get` to each index in \( is \), and the indices in \( is \) are strictly increasing. Formally, if \( l' \) is a sublist of \( l \), then there exists a sequence of indices \( is \) such that \( l' = \text{List.map } (l.\text{get}) \, is \) and \( \text{List.Pairwise } (fun \, x \, x_1 \, => \, x < x_1) \, is \).

2. **Informal Proof**  
To prove the theorem, we start with the hypothesis that \( l' \) is a sublist of \( l \). By the theorem that if \( l' \) is a sublist of \( l \), then there exists a sequence of indices \( is \) such that \( l' \) is equal to the list obtained by applying the function \( l[x] \) to each index in \( is \), and the indices in \( is \) are strictly increasing, we can simplify our goal. Specifically, using the hypothesis \( h \) that \( l' \) is a sublist of \( l \), we can show that there exists a sequence of indices \( is \) such that \( l' = \text{List.map } (l.\text{get}) \, is \) and \( \text{List.Pairwise } (fun \, x \, x_1 \, => \, x < x_1) \, is \). This completes the proof.
