The previous lean 4 proof has the following errors. 
6. **Error Message**
tmp.lean:11:10: error: unknown identifier 'xs'
tmp.lean:11:4: error: tactic 'cases' failed, major premise type is not an inductive type
  ?m.229

Explanation: the 'cases' tactic is for constructor-based reasoning as well as for applying custom cases principles with a 'using' clause or a registered '@[cases_eliminator]' theorem. The above type neither is an inductive type nor has a registered theorem.
