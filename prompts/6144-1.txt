The previous lean 4 proof has the following errors. 
6. **Error Message**
tmp.lean:12:4: error: tactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify
  (swap ?o).swap = ?o
with
  o = o.swap.swap
case mp
α : Type u_1
β : Type u_2

⊢ o = o.swap.swap

Please revise the proof accordingly - but always pick up exactly where the given prefix ends. DO NOT include backticks, explanations, comments, code fences or any other text before or after the proof.
